        "en": "Odyssey is primarily a decentralized sharing economy and peer-to-peer ecosystem, aiming to compete with and replace the likes of Airbnb and Uber. Odyssey dreams big - aiming to completely replace the concept of private ownership with an economy in which everything is shared and little is owned. It\u2019s a long way from its goals, of course, but making peer-to-peer sharing more efficient with smart contracts is certainly a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe Odyssey website lists 9 advisors, with its primary two being Yi Shi, the CEO of Shanghai\u2019s Avazu Holding, a leading global advertising platform, and Justin Sun, the backbone of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">TRON</a> cryptocurrency. The advisory team also includes Goh Jian Kai, founder and CEO of Southeast Asia\u2019s cross-border payment solution system RateX.\r\n\r\nOdyssey has lofty goals, aiming to create a world where sharing is the norm and ownership or sharing monopoly doesn\u2019t come in the way of people\u2019s lives. A decentralized sharing platform where all service providers and customers are connected definitely sounds attractive. It\u2019s a new currency, so it needs development to reach its goals. Of course, the fact that buying a large number of OCN tokens will not put a major dent in your pocket is a definite point in its favour."
