The Coin peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of a local sovereign currency in our reserves which is equal to the number of OWDT in circulation when liquidation or remittance occurs.\r\n\r\nLaunched in October 2020, Oduwausd is deployed on its legacy blockchain. The stated purpose of OWDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies, which can be sent between users without a trusted third-party intermediary. With one OWDT equal to one USD when converting local sovereign currency in Africa to USD in real-time with\r\nno currency manipulation.\""
