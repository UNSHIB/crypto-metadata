        "en": "Mastercoin / Omni is a digital currency built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its features include the development of a decentralised exchange and the implementation of smart property and savings wallet. \r\n\r\nThe Master Protocol facilitates the creation and trading of smart properties and user currencies as well as other types of smart contracts. Mastercoin enables the Bitcoin eco-system to become more decentralized.\r\n\r\nThe Mastercoin project was launched on 31 July 2013 with a one-month long fundraiser. Those interested in obtaining Mastercoin may send bitcoin to an \"Exodus Address\" where the funds collected would be used to fund the development of Mastercoin. Around 500 people invested in Mastercoin sending roughly 5000 bitcoins to the Mastercoin project.\r\n\r\n"
