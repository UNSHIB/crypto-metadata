Orient arrives at the DeFI market to innovate, choosing an ethereum network with great liquidity and volume and ERC20 token, deploying staking resources, agriculture, among others, where the project seeks a reward for a certain time, participate in the Orient networks,  it will be a great opportunity to start low and get it for a long period rewards!
