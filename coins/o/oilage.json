        "en": "OILage is a global, decentralized Prosumer Energy system featuring a dual token system for convenient and fair exchange of renewable energy between bioenergy companies (prosumers) and users (hosts). The platform includes the OILage token (OIL) which represents platform maintenance and value, while the POWer Token (POW) is a token earned by OIL holders for host/prosumer transactions that represent the value of traded power.\r\n\r\nAfter the project is launched, a certain amount of business return is paid in POWER every quarter, commensurate to the OIL held through snapshots. POW tokens will be used only for services that have secured the equivalent value of legal money while conducting the OILage projects. "
