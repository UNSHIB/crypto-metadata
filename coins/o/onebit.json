        "en": "OneBit $1bit is a cross-chain non-tax token with manual burns, launching on BSC followed by Etherum, Polygon, Fantom, and more. Payment use-case reveals after CEX listing. We will NOT be following the Gamefi and NFT trend and waste our time/funds on ANYTHING other than HARDCORE MARKETING. For every 5000 holders reached, we will buy back and burn 20% of the remaining total supply. "
