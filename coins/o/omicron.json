        "en": "Omicron is a decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the Arbitrum Network based on the OMIC token. Each OMIC token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. USDC, OMIC-MIM LP) in the OMIC treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. OMIC also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding."
