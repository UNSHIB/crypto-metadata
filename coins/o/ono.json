        "en": "ONO is a social network based on blockchain technology which focuses on the value of attention and offers a free, decentralised social platform to a new generation of users. ONO is based on the belief in the value of attention. As far as ONO is concerned, there exists many valuable human social activities within a social media ecosystem and ONO recognises the inherent value of both the supply-side and demand-side of human cognitive and social energy. The ONO team believes in equality. As far as ONO is concerned, since everybody is born equal as human beings, so the means available for them to obtain incentives and gain attention in social platforms shall also be equal."
