        "en": "OpenOcean is the world's first DeFi & CeFi full aggregator. OpenOcean's intelligent routing algorithm finds the best price and lowest slippage for traders across centralized and decentralized exchanges with no additional fees.  As one-stop entrance, we aggregate major exchanges DEXes across 5 public chains, Ethereum, Ethereum Layer 2 (Loopring), Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Polygon, Ontology, TRON, and CEX on Binance. OpenOcean will continue to support cross-chain swaps via bridges and cross-chain protocols, and more cross-chain protocols and aggregate more DeFi & CeFi products such as derivative, lending & Insurance products.\r\n\r\nThe vision of OpenOcean is to build a full aggregator for crypto trading that serves as a bridge connecting the isolated islands in the current fragmented DeFi and CeFi markets. Regardless of being a small individual investor or large institution, everyone should have the opportunity to trade at the best prices and apply their own investment strategies on various crypto asset classes."
