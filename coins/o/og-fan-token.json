They\u2019re also currently the only team to ever be crowned World Dota 2 Champions twice.\r\n\r\nWilling to take a step further in becoming an esports powerhouse, we decided to create OG Seed, to help grow Dota 2 players, and welcomed an amazing CS:GO roster as well.\r\nWe may be skilled, but the true strength of OG is its people."
