        "en": "Orbitcoin is a PoW/PoS coin that is the first coin to implement 0% PoS staking. Orbitcoin's goal is to be used on the normal Internet and darknets like I2P/Tor. At the moment, Orbitcoin works with SOCKS over I2P/Tor. Native support for I2P will be in place soon. Orbitcoin is one of the oldest PoW/PoS altcoins that was launched on the 30th of July 2013. Orbitcoin is founded by Ghostlander, a male located somewhere in Europe. "
