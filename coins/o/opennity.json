        "en": "Some believe blockchain technology will end up transforming a number of important industries, from healthcare to politics. As blockchain technology continues to emerge, traditional industries are beginning to explore the possibility of integration into their respective fields. However, finding the appropriate talent can be difficult for both blockchain and traditional companies. There\u2019s the issue of not knowing where to look or if they found a person, being able to verify their accomplishments in previous blockchain roles. Opennity is a new community and referral economy which connects global professionals in the blockchain industry. Users can monetize their connections by using Opennity\u2019s\r\nincentivized program that encourages users to refer valuable connections for financial rewards. The Opennity community is built on a decentralized platform to assure transparency and authentic transactions. The platform gives projects and service providers the opportunity\r\nto find the best matches and promote themselves in order to accomplish genuine blockchain projects that will bring positive change to real-world businesses."
