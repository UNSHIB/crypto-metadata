        "en": "It is well known that Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is considered as energy efficient, decentralized, very secure system. And, at the same time, PoS blockchain network makes it possible to draw benefits from just holding cryptocurrency without acquiring costly crypto mining equipment or renting hashpower. Put simply, everyone who possess Proof of Stake coin and run that coin's wallet on their computer becomes a Stakeholder and can earn Staking Rewards. Because of all the above-mentioned reasons,  we have created 2X2 - PoS cryptocurrency which, despite the crypto market fluctuations, can generate passive income stream for its holders"
