The main goal of the Coin is to release a positive and charitable Crypto Currency.

About one quarter of people will experience some kind of mental health problem in the course of a year, with mixed anxiety and depression. Mental health problems are found in people of all ages, regions, states, countries and societies. Did you know suicide remains the most common cause of death in men under the age of 35?"
