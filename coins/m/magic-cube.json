        "en": "MC Exchange (hereinafter referred to as MC) is a game asset ecosystem based on blockchain. The core license to distribute games by helping game developers use smart contracts is IGO (Game Token Trading Platform). It solves the existing dilemma of the game and realizes the investment exit of the game, thus subverting the existing game industry structure. The MCC is the only pair of transactions on the MC exchange for all GTO tokens. 100% of all tokens are generated through game behavior mining. They are used to consume game content in games. Each game has its own token, so its token economy is different."
