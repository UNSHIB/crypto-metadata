        "en": "In the future, through years of endeavor over generations, humanity will finally turn the magnificent dream of Dyson Ball into reality and the energy crisis will be solved. \r\n\r\nHuman beings simulate real space and time with the supercomputer \u201cdroplets\u201d as the core, and synchronize the laws of the universe and human consciousness to the virtual world. The virtual world is like the universe evolving from a singularity, and finally upgraded to a virtual universe that connects all life consciousness.  Humans named the virtual universe \u201cMetaverse\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe operation of \u201cMetaverse\u201d requires powerful computing power and energy, and the computing power of \u201cdroplets\u201d has gradually reached its limit, which requires the construction of more energy supplies. To this end, the \u201cMetaverse\u201d Management Alliance started a project code-named \u201cMetaverse Miner\u201d. It aims to encourage adventurous explorers to explore a wider range of galaxies, use terminal control machines to obtain various primal energies in unfamiliar galaxies, and link \u201cMetaverse\u201d to every human planet through the interstellar logistics network."
