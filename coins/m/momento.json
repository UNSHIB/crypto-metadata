        "en": "A DEFI+NFT project that aims to portray some of the most iconic and fascinating moments of the past decade that helps you to earn through the NFTs you buy.\r\nWe have 2 broad categories of NFTs:\r\na. General Category - Where we depict some of the most talked about moments of the past decade\r\nb. Cryptocurrencies - Where we depict the journey of some of the most prominent and upcoming cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThrough our NFTs, people will be able to earn through multiple forms.\r\n\r\na. There is a 3% redistribution per transaction. So you earn just by holding.\r\nb. You can stake the NFTs you own with just a couple of clicks and start earning staking rewards\r\nc. The subsequent NFT sales get redistributed to the initial holders so more income from just holding the NFTs. \r\n\r\nThere is a 10% tax per buy/sell:\r\n\r\n3% - Liquidity (Increased the price floor over time)\r\n3% - Redistributed to holders (Passive income)\r\n4% - Buyback and burn (Anti-dump measure)"
