Mini Thunder is a token sent by Thor himself to rid the BSC space of scams and poorly executed projects by utilizing their god-like tokenomics and their Kraken named Mjolnir. Mjolnir will help Mini Thunder pump with his divine buyback and burn capabilities which will be utilized to create massive fomo and buy pressure at the perfect moment. Vaults of Valhalla, their casino, is going live at launch and will feature their first game with many more to be added over the first weeks! "
