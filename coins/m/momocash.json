        "en": "MomoCash is an innovative cryptocurrency. A form of digital currency secured by cryptography and issued through a decentralized and advanced mining market. Based on Dash, it's an enhanced version, featuring the masternode technology with 50% Reward, near-instant and secure payments as well as anonymous transactions.\r\n\r\nMomo is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Momo uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. MomoCash Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency. \r\n\r\nThe emergence of blockchain-based decentralized digital currencies woke up hopes for the beginning of a better world. A world, where wealth is distributed fairly without control and influence of a powerful middleman. Although blockchain technology equipped us with a perfect tool to make this dream come true, it will not happen by itself. \r\n\r\nThe concept of a socially responsible cryptocurrency inspired us to create Ultima - a platform designed to support endeavors of its community in various areas. The Ultima Multi-Module Platform (MMP) includes functionalities ranging from a digital marketplace to crowdfunding and charity components. By working together on noble causes we will regain the faith in cryptocurrencies."
