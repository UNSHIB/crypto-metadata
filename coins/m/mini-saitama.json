        "en": "miniSAITAMA was originally a rugged token by a dev that sadly decided to rug. A few members of the community have decided to take over the coin and airdrop all holders their aquired amounts in a new contract. Being revived, miniSAITAMA enables people to exchange other rug pulled tokens for their initial investment in ETH.\r\nA platform built with the intention to give rather than take, that will pay out victims of rugs. Becoming the insurance of the meme token space."
