        "en": "Maya Coin will be the first ever cryptocurrency token ever to bring mergers and acquisition to the crypto world. Maya Coin will not only use blockchain technology to perform acquisitions of existing blockchain technology companies, but will also be used to acquire all types of assets including the purchases of profitable private & public companies that are outside the blockchain technology industry.\r\n\r\nMaya Coin will be used as a monetary instrument to acquire assets such as real estate, patents, existing profitable private and public companies along with other intellectual properties. Maya Coin also incubates development of business ideas and companies with high growth potential. Every acquisition, business idea or existing business that Maya Coin creates/acquires will then be put into its own cryptocurrency vehicle."
