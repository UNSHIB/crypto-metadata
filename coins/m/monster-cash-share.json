        "en": "MonsterSlayerFinance is an algorithmic synthetics platform: infinite-scalable, long-term sustainable, and decentralized. \r\nOur approach to stabilization \u2013 implementing best practice of seigniorage combined with a special stabilization fund to limit the effect of post-farming dumping.\r\nMonster Slayer Cash tokens are designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol deterministically expands and contracts the MSC supply to maintain MSC's peg to 1 $BUSD token (which trades close to a single United States Dollar). \r\n During epoch expansions (when TWAP - the time-weighted average price of MSC is above the 1 $BUSD peg), the protocol mints MSC and distributes it proportionally to all Monster Slayer Share (MSS) holders who have staked their tokens inside the boardroom. When MSC's TWAP falls below 1 $BUSD peg, Monster Slayer Bond (MSB) gets issued and can be bought with MSC at its prevailing price."
