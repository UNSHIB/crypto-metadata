It doesn\u2019t collect any data, it doesn\u2019t request anything other than your email to signup, and you create a Memo (meemo) that represents your user as you have the right to not reveal any information about who you really are.\r\nThe platform aims to be a replacement for Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube, by offering more creator friendly policies that don\u2019t screw anyone over."
