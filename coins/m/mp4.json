        "en": "MP4 is the daughter of Blockchain Music Entertainment (BME), and the sister of the music industry decentralization DAPP, MP3. Together, we will tokenize the world and create an entirely new system of value.\r\n\r\nWhat MP3 does for the music industry, MP4 does for the film/content industry; why should independent film creators have to be hidden in the shadows of the Hollywood monopoly? It's time for filmmakers and influencers to have access to a worldwide network of investors to support their creative endeavors.\r\n\r\nNow talented film and content creators can pitch their ideas to a worldwide audience of investors to make their creative dreams come to life - and influencers can tokenize their products, services, and subscriptions to interact with the web3 blockchain economy."
