        "en": "A lottery platform that is conventionally ruled, anonymously played, and autonomously operated, MyLottoCoin aims to be a disruptive solution to official and online lottery problems, a truly decentralized gaming platform designed to empower players and reconstruct the lottery concept from a gambling nature to a safe bet DeFi-powered feature while trying to maintain the joy of traditional experience. \r\n\r\nMyLottoCoin has introduced a reward program (staking +) powered by project\u2019s native token, MYL. MYL token was originally created to facilitate the reward program. MYL holders receive 10% of total ticket sales in ETH in proportion to the tokens in circulation, autonomously every 3 months. From the total supply of MYL (100 million), 50% is locked in the games smart contracts for free redistribution among users."
