Part of our mission is helping scale the Ethereum ecosystem, which is where the idea of \u2018middleware strategies\u2019 comes into play. Our solutions can be thought of as an \u2018APY strategy\u2019 that you might find with something like Yearn Finance, except instead of providing capital (e.g. through depositing into a strategy with Yearn), we create applications that provide services that generate revenue (a prime example being YCabal)."
