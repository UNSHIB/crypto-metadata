        "en": "A decentralized and community-owned currency, MUNCH tokens are creating a fairer, more evenly distributed system that anyone can be a part of. All Munch transactions are subject to a 7% transaction fee that is distributed back to the community and charitable causes. Of this 7% collected,2% goes to marketing/buybacks and burns 2% will be redistributed to the community of MUNCH holders and 3% will be sent directly to a charitable cause, decided by the community. All donations and rewards are programmed to be inherently secure, automated, trustless, and immutable via the locked design of the contract. We\u2019re biting back against traditional financial models and taking a bite out of poverty and hunger around the world at the same time. MUNCH gives people the opportunity to participate in a unique currency and marketplace, earn rewards, and distribute money to causes they support. The community decides the direction and future of MUNCH."
