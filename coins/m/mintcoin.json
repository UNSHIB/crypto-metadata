        "en": "MintCoin is a new Proof of Work (POW) / Proof of Stake (POW) hybrid cryptocurrency coin. It's objective is to become the next innovative, secure, and energy efficient cryptocoin in the market.\r\n\r\nMintCoin is distributed using a fast POW distribution mechanism, and after 5 weeks, it becomes a pure POS coin. This makes the coin completely energy efficient in order to sustain itself, not having to depend on resource intensive mining rigs.\r\n\r\nMintCoin now runs on 100% Proof-of-Stake to secure the network. After the year 2016, stakers will receive a fixed 5% indefinitely as reward for securing the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoS variable interests:\r\n- 1st year: 20%\r\n- 2nd year: 15%\r\n- 3rd year: 10%\r\n- 4th and subsequent years: 5%\r\n\r\nMintCoin is often compared with its close counterpart - <a href='http://www.coingecko.com/coins/peercoin'>Peercoin</a> and <a href='http://www.coingecko.com/coins/nxt'>NXT</a>"
