        "en": "Mimosa is a creeping annual or perennial flowering plant. The compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, defending themselves from harm, and re-open a few minutes later. The project is named after mimosa according to the properties of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe Mimosa team is composed of Japanese economics researchers. Through a new generation of deflation agreement based on the Ethereum chain, it responses to the inflation caused by the loose monetary policies and liquidity mining in the encryption filed, Mimo for shot.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the existing liquidity mining, token staking, derivative futures, etc., make the circulation of assets on the market keep increasing. In the absence of new investors, it will bring more pressure on the existing investors. This does not contribute to the development of the industry, nor can the market value of innovative projects (other than bitcoin) continue to grow."
