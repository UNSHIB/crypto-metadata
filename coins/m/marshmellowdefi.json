We are your go-to yield farm running on Binance Smart Chain and Pancakeswap exchange, with lots of other features that let you earn tokens. As with the current wave of second-generation yield farms, the aim is to create a perpetual deflation token, the MASH, with a continual burn mechanism in order to field an environment that can sustain long-term gains with consistently high APR for greater earnings."
