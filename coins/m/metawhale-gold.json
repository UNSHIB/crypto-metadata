        "en": "Fiat currency and Bitcoin have opposing monetary policies. Fiat is inflationary (money printing) and Bitcoin is deflationary (fixed supply and BTC is lost over time). But both are similar by the fact that they are backed by nothing. MetaWhale Gold ($MWG) has the same deflationary monetary policy of Bitcoin, but it actually has reserve assets of PAXG (gold!) to back it up. As the MWG supply deflates, the PAXG gold reserves keep increasing in size.\r\n\r\nMetaWhale Gold introduces the first truly sustainable Crypto Gold Standard.\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n\r\nMetaWhale Gold is a new paradigm in elastic supply tokenomics. It employs a self-renewable deflationary monetary policy that\u2019s backed by self-filling reserves of tokenized and redeemable physical gold. MetaWhale Gold integrates the category of Value MetaWhale as it establishes its value from its reserves of tokenized gold, an asset that has the longest track record as a reliable store of value.\r\n\r\nAll around the cryptosphere are deflationary tokens, but market participants who enter after the implosion stage can only lose money as the systems collapse. Given that these protocols aren\u2019t backed by anything other than their own tokens, the remaining holders get left with an important lesson about the true market value of their tokens. In MetaWhale Gold, deflation happens at the same time the protocol fills its own reserves. In doing so, the protocol allows all market participants to make the most out of a deflationary model whilst knowing to a deterministic certainty that their MetaWhale Gold holdings are backed by reserves of tokenized physical gold.\r\n\r\nMetaWhale Gold Supply:\r\n\r\nInitial Total Supply: 1,000,000 MWG\r\nInitial Ciculating Supply: 850,000 MWG\r\nCEX Allocation: 150,000 MWG (optional)\r\nMinimum Supply: 1 MWG\r\nAdditional Mintable Airdrop: 350,000 MWG (maximum possible)\r\n\r\nEvery MetaWhale Gold Buy:\r\n\r\nBurns 1.25% of the total transaction value.\r\nSends 1.25% of the total transaction value to MetaWhale Gold reserves.\r\n\r\nEvery MetaWhale Gold Sell:\r\n\r\nBurns 2.50% of the total transaction value.\r\nSends 3.75% of the total transaction value MetaWhale Gold reserves.\r\n\r\nMetaWhale Gold Reserve:\r\n\r\nReserve Asset: Paxos Gold (PAXG)\r\n\r\nMetaWhale Gold Liquidity:\r\n\r\nProvided and locked during the launch\r\nAuto-liquidity provision built into the Reserve Actions."
