        "en": "Manna (ticker MANNA), which was launched on May 1, 2015 as Grantcoin (GRT), is the first cryptocurrency distributed primarily by a charitable nonprofit organization as Universal Basic Income to people around the world. Manna's technology is based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin (PPCoin)</a>, an offshoot of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. Like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, the Manna network is currently powered by SHA-256 Proof-of-Work mining, and does not use <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin's</a> Proof-of-Stake system for distributing block rewards."
