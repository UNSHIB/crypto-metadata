        "en": "Musubi is a reflective ERC-20 community token with a dynamic fee structure that rewards holders, especially when whales take profit. It has a dynamic fee structure that is directly relative to a sell's price impact, with minimum of 10% fee and maximum of 40% fee. There are no sell restrictions, so we welcome whales in our ecosystem - and minnows benefit greatly when whales take profit!\r\n\r\nMusubi also features a unique approach to fee-taking that mitigates the huge dumps that follow massive pumps on other fee-taking contracts. This creates a gorgeous chart, and doesn't dramatically punish buyers who jumped in on the way up!"
