        "en": "Launched on August 14th by a global team, MiniBNB is a redistributive token with a tiered giveaway strategy. MiniBNB holders will be rewarded with redistributions in MiniBNB and have a chance to get BNB in a tiered giveaway. The concept of a Giveaway Wallet is used and includes collecting redistributions in BNB and giving them back to the holders. There will be 15 wallets chosen for a BNB giveaway every week where 5 wallets from each of 3 tiers will be selected. The tiers will be given BNB as follows: the top tier will be given 50% of the Giveaway Wallet, the second tier will be given 30% of the Giveaway Wallet, and the third tier will be given 20% of the Giveaway Wallet. The tiers will be based on MiniBNB token amount standing as seen on BSCscan where Tier 1 will include the top 100 wallets, Tier 2 will include wallets 101-1000, and Tier 3 will include wallets 1001 and beyond. In addition, MiniBNB holders will be given an opportunity to join the MiniBNB club that will offer them exclusive benefits."
