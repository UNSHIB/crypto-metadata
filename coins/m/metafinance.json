        "en": "\"Meta\" refers to the basic units that make things up. Meta is a new generation of combined decentralized products. Each Meta product can be viewed as a separate module. By introducing new products from different Meta product combinations, the effect of 1+1>2 can be achieved. A Dapp may be mundane today, but taken together it creates ingenious chemistry and infinite possibilities.\r\nIn the following product iteration, we will continue to introduce new product categories. Each decentralized smart contract will interact with each other, resulting in a multiplier effect. We have Metaboard, MetaPool, MetaDAO, and will include any other Meta anywhere in the future. Such as stability currency, DEX, derivatives, NFT, insurance and so on. Through a variety of investment portfolio, for users to bring a substantial return on capital. Meta will become the benchmark and cornerstone of programmable finance in the future."
