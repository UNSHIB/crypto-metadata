The price discovery mechanism and the free market will determine the fair value of the token. Note that the initial rate might be changed on launch date to be as close to 1 USD\r\n\r\nP(robability)\r\nP from Probability, represents an adaptation of probablistic model that apply to the asset yield, to reflect the randomness of the world onto an asset, creating a uniqueness of this new digital commodity.\r\n\r\nL(ife)\r\nL from Life, represents the ever-changing value and supply in the asset, based on a series of random events, with no certainty, no final destination, an constantly evolving digital commodity similar to life itself."
