The YFD ecosystem is a community-centered project aiming to rebuild all classes of financial services provided in traditional finance but through DeFi protocols (farming, governance, insurance, credit, exchange, self-banking etc.). All solutions will be community-developed and all profits generated by the ecosystem will be automatically redistributed to all contributors (YFD token holders)."
