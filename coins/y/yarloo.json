        "en": "Yarloo is a P2E company that utilizes NFTs as the core asset behind gameplay mechanics and the P2E model, in addition to their very own RST (Revenue Sharing Token) method, which distributes a percentage of the company's monthly revenue across \"\"pillars\"\" that support market value and encourage more community activities. \r\n\r\nThe first flagship project to launch under Yarloo's development is a trading card game called \"\"Pirateers\"\" - which concentrates on bringing seasonal content in a similar formula to how renowned AAA studios utilize their service-based games, and bring them to crypto gaming to maintain the game's longevity. \r\n\r\nYarloo was originally founded in January of 2021 originally as a trading card game lottery concept then later pivoted into a full-on gaming company. The team is international, with most of the company's members in Brazil, and the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nThe project was launched publicly in August, with Binance Smart Chain and Polygon for the first network launches given how user-friendly they are in terms of fees, as the company seeks to avoid large transaction fees so as not to lose traffic for the games or the ecosystem's projects in general.\r\n\r\nYarloo has a number of upcoming projects in the roadmap as well, like Battleships, a PVP/PVE fleet-building strategy game that will allow players to customize their own NFT ships, conquer certain areas of the seas, and try to take the most control possible over the world's map - on top of that is an interoperable cross-chain marketplace named NFTShore, due for release in 2021."
