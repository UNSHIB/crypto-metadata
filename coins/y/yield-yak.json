Our community compounds rewards, suggests new strategies, proposes key configuration updates and contributes to development. Yield Yak farms can run forever, without the team's involvement.\r\n\r\nStaked $YAK will receive $AVAX. YY network revenue (collected in tokens, usually) will be converted to AVAX and distributed to stakers."
