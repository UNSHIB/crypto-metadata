In this plataform, the gaming community will be able to buy private content from their favorite players and thus learn and improve their skill, we will also add a NFT Marketplace.\r\n\r\nFinally, in this Utility Phase, we will focus on game development, which will allow us to increase and consolidate the use of the UrGaming token, improving the growth of our community, as well as strengthening ties with gamers from all over the world."
