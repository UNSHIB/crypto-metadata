        "en": "UBIX.Network is a DAG/blockchain hybrid designed to integrate blockchains of various types of consensus into a single p2p network. Users can create their own blockchains of various types (including private ones), using them to service their business processes. At the same time, all created blockchains are in a single address space, in a common network, and can be integrated with each other without using any gateways.The interface is a super-app (Wechat-like architecture) built on a microservices, which allows various internal applications to be integrated with each other, providing users with the smooth use of various cryptoservices.\r\n"
