        "en": "UNBNK (pronounced Unbanked) is a DeFi Liquidity Protocol designed for connecting peer to peer lenders and borrowers. The UNBNK Liquidity Protocol provides a platform allowing borrowers to pledge certain assets, including NFT and digital tokens or coins, in borrowing money from private individual lenders.\r\n\r\nWe enable anyone, anywhere to gain on-chain exposure to a range of assets either liquid or illiquid. Users can utilize the protocol in a traditional lending/borrowing model facilitated by smart contracts to leverage digital assets as collateral to borrow funds from other users of the Protocol. The UNBNK Protocol can also assist users to collateralize traditional CeFi products like debit cards from Unbanked.com\r\n\r\nWith UNBNK, a global ecosystem of independent borrowers and lenders can come together to get loans or earn interest on assets they already own or are able to pledge as collateral for a loan. No financial institution is needed! Our peer-to-peer marketplace provides an avenue that allows borrowers and lenders to come together and participate in a new financial revolution.\r\n\r\nThe UNBNK protocol support assets like ETH, USDC, wrapped assets like wBTC, and a variety of NFTs from curated sources. We currently only allow white-listed sources to ensure quality and will be expanding over time."
