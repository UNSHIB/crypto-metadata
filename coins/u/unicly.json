Built by NFT collectors and DeFi enthusiasts, the protocol incentivizes NFT liquidity and provides a seamless trading experience for NFT assets.\r\n\r\nThe UNIC token is going through a fair launch where tokens can only be minted through liquidity mining. The supply of UNIC will never reach 1 million, as inflation rate decreases each month. Token holders can govern the protocol by voting."
