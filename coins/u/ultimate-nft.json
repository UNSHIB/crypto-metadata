        "en": "Unft is a fantasy premiere league hosted on the ethereum blockchain\r\nDetailed description:Ultimate NFT, like any other traditional fantasy league, allows players to construct their teams to their liking, in order to capture as many points as possible during a sports game such as Basketball, Football and Rugby. The team will offer an unlimited amount of packs in different tiers starting with bronze, silver and gold which would contain the number of players you would need to start your team. However, there will also be limited edition/rare player cards that will be released in limited quantities and are higher value NFTS on the marketplace. The points offered by the rare and common cards are the same, but, the valuation is estimated to be much higher especially as the player base grows."
