        "en": "Uniris blockchain offers the first integrated services platform capable of meeting a fundamental need- giving everyone back the control over technology. In this way, Uniris is part of the promise of a safer, more inclusive, and truly decentralized world.\r\n\r\n4 years of research and 12 strong international patents endow Uniris with the technological attributes that its predecessors have lacked -\r\nscalability, speed, reliability and simplicity of native biometric recognition. These patents will be given to the open source community to foster participation and hence accelerate the pace of innovation.Designed for mass adoption, Uniris relies on a new form of unbreakable validation consensus (ARCH), which is ultra-secure and allows an unlimited number of transactions. Uniris embeds biometry in a native wayusing a method of identification that is tamper-proof and accessible to all. This technology uses the incredible complexity of the inside of the fingers, unique to each individual without the need to store any biometric data. Our cryptocurrency, the UCO, is the backbone of the network that fuels the transactions and monetizes the contributors\u2019 investments, pays the miners, and develops the ecosystem built for the people by the people. Our blockchain platform aims to replace and to improve all current applications with a comprehensive and open ecosystem, allowing people to move from the trust imposed by centralized systems (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Banks...) to a decentralized system where everyone will retain control of their data, property, and privacy. Uniris gives back to humanity control over technology, and to each individual, control over their identity.\""
