        "en": "URG-U is part of the UrGaming Ecosystem and is the token for the URG University platform. The objective of this platform is that the players of different competitive video games can buy courses to improve their skills, dictated by the best players from each of these games. This platform will allow the best players in the world to generate a passive income with each of the sales made on this platform, helping them to improve their income and financial stability, which in e-sports is something really difficult to achieve.\r\n\r\nURG University will solve this problem, supporting the highest level players as well as those streamers who also want to sell their courses through this platform in order to improve their income as well as the stability of their profession.\r\n\r\nThe platform's business model will allow the URG University's earnings to be reinvested in buying the same URG-U token, in this way, it will help to boost the price of the token and thus benefit all its holders. In addition, marketing once the platform is already online, will be massive, focusing mainly on the main function that is education within video games in order to attract those who want to improve their skills and results."
