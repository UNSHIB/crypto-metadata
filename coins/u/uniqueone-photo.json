Photographers are not charged fees to mint their work \u2014 they are rewarded.\r\nUnique.Photo caters to the specific need of photographers, helps them tokenize their work to prove provenance for sales, and shows them how to get rewarded for using the Unique.Photo platform.\r\nIn keeping with the Unique.One ethos, Unique.Photo will have a fair launch."
