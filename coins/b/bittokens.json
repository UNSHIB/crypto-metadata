        "en": "The BitToken is an improved Bitcoin. Experiencing faster block times, BitToken excels in providing the populace with a more convenient alternative due to faster transactions. BitTokens won't face the same full block issues as Bitcoin as it can maintain more than 3x transaction capacity in the timeframe of a Bitcoin block. In the future, improvements will be added to the codebase, pulled from other successful currencies to allow BitTokens to function with the benefits of many innovative coins."
