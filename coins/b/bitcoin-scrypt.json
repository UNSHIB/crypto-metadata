        "en": "Bitcoin Scrypt allows for decentralized development by allowing users to vote on development issues based on coin ownership percentages. This will prevent a situation similar to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/price_charts/bitcoin/usd\">Bitcoin</a> where development follows a centralized approach. Users can also propose issues to vote on such as whether to change to hashing algorithm, introduce anonymity feature etc."
