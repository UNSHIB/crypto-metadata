        "en": "Even though the legalization of cannabis is gaining traction, the cannabis industry is still largely fragmented due to the economic ecosystem that remains shrouded in black market practices. Budbo will be the first-of-its-kind, fully integrated blockchain-based solution for the transparent, standardized, and regulated interaction between cannabis users, dispensaries and couriers. Budbo is a best-in-class platform already actively being used by more than 75,000 mobile users and over 2000 suppliers (dispensaries).\r\n\r\n"
