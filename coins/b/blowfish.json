        "en": "BlowFish is a gamification platform. Our entertaining DApps have the purpose of increasing the value of BLOWF. The first DApp release was a fair lottery that burns 5% of the lottery pool. Integrated with a provably fair randomness Oracle, the BlowFish Lottery offers players a level playing field.\r\n\r\nThe second DApp release were NFT's that lock BLOWF tokens. NFT sales directly add to BlowFish value by auto-buying BlowFish tokens and locking tokens via a smart contract. Upcoming NFT features include a marketplace and further gamification to boost NFT utility and value.\r\n\r\nOur roadmap includes charity outreach and further development of DApps."
