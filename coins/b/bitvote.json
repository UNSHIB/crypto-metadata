        "en": "Bitvote is a fork of Bitcoin, and its abbreviation is BTV. There will be no premining and additional issuance.\r\n\r\nBitvote uses the CryptoNight algorithm, which responds to Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of one-CPU-one-vote and true decentralization.\r\n\r\nBitvote establishes a foundation and promotes a sustainable development of communities. Features such as smart contract, lightning network, community vote and others will be added to Bitvote finally."
