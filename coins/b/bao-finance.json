While we are in the process of scaling the team, please understand the risks and use this product accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt's like SNX + Aave, but for Uniswap, SushiSwap and Balancer.\r\n\r\nRather than re-invent the wheel Bao creates new features for existing protocols.\r\n\r\nThe BAO token acts as a governance token for the fully community run project. It is also backed by the insurance fund where all Bao fees go."
