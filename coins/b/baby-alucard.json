        "en": "Our goal for Baby Alucard is to show cryptocurrency that redistribution within tokens can provide an appropriate form of passive income and at the same time create a project entirely commmunity driven and decentralized. By obtaining key partnerships, building useful utility with suggestions taken from the community, and offering passive income via our tokenomics, we believe we can change the focus of defi in a crypto project today."
