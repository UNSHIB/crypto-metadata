        "en": "Documentary show Tiger King star Carole Baskin has formally announced her \u201cfan token\u201d called $CAT\u2014an altcoin that is intended for supporters of her Big Cat Rescue animal sanctuary. Baskin emphasizes the coin is not intended for investment,  but rather \u201ca purr-ency of our fans to show their love for the cats and to reap the benefits of being our most forward thinking partners in creating a world where all wild cats live free.\u201d\r\n\r\nBig Cat Rescue is caring for wildcats and ending the trade as pets, props and parts. Imagine a virtually connected world where people who love big cats can join with others and share access to the augmented reality ARzoo and the virtual reality game Big Cat Rescue VR and can collect all their favorite exotic cats, past and present. Gaming can reach younger audiences with the message that big cats are not to be held hostage, and virtual big cats could be pre programmed to resist such egomaniacal efforts through peeing on and constantly attacking their owners. (Just like in real life!) The ultimate goal of all of this is to end the abuse inherent in holding wildcats captive and creating remote camera feeds that bring the wild cats into your headsets and hands doing what they naturally do in the wild"
