        "en": "Bridge Protocol (BRDG) is building new tools and standards for businesses, KYC and ICOs. The Bridge Protocol provides enterprise solutions using blockchain technology to comply to global regulations. Our work involves creating avenues for safe, legal and compliant Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Bridge is creating an open, distributed network of validators which regulate the behavior of its participants to provide high assurance interactions.\r\n\r\nBridge Protocol offers standardization tools for blockchain and non-blockchain business processes. Tier classification allows for compliance through contract code. These strategies allow for lower cost KYC and legal vetting between parties without the hassle. Our digital certificates keep your sensitive information off the chain and secure, so the user and business have instant points-of-trust.\r\n\r\nBridge will allow existing integration to standard practices by way of digitalization of agreements like the SAFT, employment arrangements and more.\r\n\r\nBridge BRDG tokens fuel the storefronts that offer identity services, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) solutions and access legal services providers on the blockchain."
