        "en": "The main efforts of our specialists were aimed at solving the problems of financial and economic analysis and at evaluation of the effectiveness of the\r\ninvestment project. The solution required selection of appropriate models, methods and instrumental support tools, taking into account the diversity of research in this area.\r\nAt the same time, the investment program was considered as a whole, as a complex large-scale business project.\r\nThe introduction of blockchain technologies into our investment direction has allowed us to signifi- cantly improve our financial and economic\r\nindicators, as well as significantly improve the efficien- cy and attractiveness of the project. Thanks to our model, we were able to achieve\r\nconsistency in the results of planning, high coherence in the interaction of the elements of the ecosystem and im- prove the quality of management decisions."
