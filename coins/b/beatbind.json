        "en": "BeatBind is the world\u2019s first decentralized blockchain event organization and talent auction platform that will allow artists and venues to focus only on providing unforgettable experiences to their fanbase. We aim to connect three key players in music event coordination: venue owners, performers, and fans. Our innovative solution will be supported with BBND, a universal cryptocurrency token for the music industry.\r\n\r\nBeatBind intends to solve music event related problems through the development of its Platform and wider event organization ecosystem. The key idea is to allow all participants in the ecosystem to efficiently connect and interact. BeatBind will capitalize on the high demand for the best artists, organizers, and venues and increase artist booking rates significantly using various auction models. BeatBind will give rising artists more opportunities both locally and globally. Furthermore, fans will be able to directly purchase tickets from organizers of all events created on BeatBind, preventing fraud, forgery, and ticket scalping."
