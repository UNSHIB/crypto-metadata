        "en": "BlockMesh, a software company based in Mauritius - utilizes the latest innovations in mesh networking technology to create cost-free communication networks and aim to disrupt the global communications industry in 2018. Mesh technology is a telecommunications system that can work outside of regular cellular tower range due to the peer-to-peer mesh network it enables. By creating a network powered by Bluetooth - or WIFI, if available - the mesh network sidesteps typical cellular and data costs imposed by the incumbents.\r\n\r\nBlockMesh started in 2015 as a mesh network provider. A mesh network is a group of devices passing information from one to another until the recipient is reached. We are using this mesh network as a communications application, and as it can operate via Bluetooth and wifi instead of data, it is essentially cost-free once you\u2019re on the network. We\u2019re also using blockchain technology which enables us to reward users for supporting the network and brings our end-goal closer."
