        "en": "PolyPup Finance is a new DeFi project on Polygon featuring a deflationary token model. This is the second layer of the project featuring BONE with a maximum supply of 65,000 tokens.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing several yield farming models we decided on a low emission rate, low supply, layered farming approach to our platform.  This model will help end users earn maximum yields over a long period of time. Buyback and burns will help stabilize a  price floor for long term holders."
