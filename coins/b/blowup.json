This is done in order to adjust the token price, without affecting the value of anyone's share of coins. This can be beneficial as the chart will always look healthy regardless of dips and we can be on the top gainer's parts of websites due to the illusion of a rise in price floor so is a brilliant marketing tool in itself."
