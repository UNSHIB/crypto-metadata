        "en": "Black Diamond was started to support homeless veterans and as an answer for the demand for higher reflections among Safe tokens. Black Diamond is intended to be the safest Anti-Whale coin on the market while offering higher reflections than any other current token. Forked from a Safe token contract we have improved upon the Anti-Whale functions by cutting the max transaction amount in half. Black Diamond was created by Veteran and Active Duty U.S Servicemen.\r\n\r\nWe have a charity wallet holding 1% of the total supply that will be donated to the National Coalition of Homeless Veterans when we hit predetermined milestones. 5% of profits from our Merch store also go to this cause\r\n\r\nWhitepaper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jY8Vetxtx1c-G0Rryv_i7aKuyRpCax0/view"
