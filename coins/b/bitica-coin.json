        "en": "Bitica Coin(bitica), created in 2018, was the first pos/pow base cryptocurrency created in Estonia (the first country to legalise Cryptocurreny). Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called bit coins, as a blend of BDCC coin alternative. BDCC and its derivatives use decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money/central banking systems. The decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin's blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed.\r\n\r\nAt Bitica, we believe in financial freedom and economic independence, which is possible through BDCC coin."
