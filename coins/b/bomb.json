        "en": "The world's first self-destructing currency.\r\n\r\nBOMB is a social experiment and financial case study to measure the feasibility of a deflationary currency.\u00a0 The rules are simple.\r\n\r\n1) There were originally 1,000,000 Bomb in existence.\r\n\r\n2) Each time a Bomb is transferred, 1% of the transaction is destroyed.\r\n\r\n3) There will never be newly minted Bomb.\r\n\r\nThe intention is\u00a0not\u00a0to be used as a transactional currency, but rather a consistent and decentralized store of value. Through a system of immutable smart contracts and continuous hyperdeflation,\u00a0BOMB is the world\u2019s first self-destructing currency."
