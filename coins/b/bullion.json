        "en": "Bullion (CBX) 'the digital precious metal' is a cryptocurrency launched in June of 2013.\r\n\r\n Ideal for storage of wealth (low inflation and low coin supply) while also fulfilling the requirements to be a medium of exchange (divisibility, security, ease of use, mobility and fast transactions).\r\n\r\n Employs an original, first of its kind algorithm, Proof-of-Stake-Participation (PoSP).\r\n\r\n PoSP is a green, energy-efficient alternative to the energy and resource consuming Proof-of-Work (employed in Bitcoin and Ethereum).\r\n\r\n Has a static annual inflation rate of 2% which is all used for rewarding Bullion owners who actively participate in the network.\r\n\r\n Owners who do not participate in the network forfeit their potential interest earnings to those who do, thereby allowing for exponentially higher than inflation rate ROI for active participants."
