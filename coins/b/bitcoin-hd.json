        "en": "Users can employ unused hard disk capacity to mine Bitcoins without the need for expensive mining rigs and other \r\nspecialized hardware.\r\n \t\r\nTraditional mining hardware is energy intensive, noisy, produces a lot of heat, and is becoming increasingly specialized, moving beyond the means of ordinary people. With BHD, mining is simple and accessible.\r\n \t\r\nPOW-based mining is all about raw computing power and energy output, whereas BHD's POC-based mining is far more energy efficient and returns to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original ideal that mining would be decentralized and performed by ordinary people.\r\n \t\r\nPOC (Proof of Capacity) scans are only performed once every few minutes. For the rest of the time the hard disk is on stand-by with negligible power usage, greatly reducing energy costs.\r\n \t\r\nBased on capacity proof, it will support super-large blocks in the future and will add functions such as \r\nzero-knowledge proof.\r\n \t\r\nSolid-state drives are expensive, POC has no requirement for fast data processing, only capacity, so POC naturally \r\neliminates ASIC chips.\r\n \t\r\nCurrently, the amount of energy expended globally in POW mining is greater than the total energy output of 159 countries. The development of digital currencies shouldn\u2019t have to be built on the wasting of resources. With BHD, POW calculations can be completed with a minimum of computing and energy resources."
