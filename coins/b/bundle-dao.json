        "en": "Bundle DAO is a new Fair launch, BSC native DeFi protocol aiming to redefine passive portfolio management. We\u2019re building a platform that enables users to trade and mint risk-controlled, non-custodial financial indices, with returns auto-compounded and underlying assets fully exposed to various protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, we\u2019re enabling single-click portfolio generation and management that rivals even highly active strategies, without the fees or hassle of interfacing directly with a variety of complex protocols. We\u2019re taking a unique approach to our launch; instead of collecting private investment or initiating a pre-sale, we\u2019re launching through a fair launch to distribute our native governance token in return for active contribution to the success of Bundle. For more in-depth information on our product and tokenomics, check out our medium articles, or the whitepaper listed in the #resources channel of our discord!"
