        "en": "BERNARD is the cutest, and kindest St-Shibernard you will ever find. A St-Shibernard is an extremely rare breed of dog, it\u2019s basically a Shiba born in the Swiss mountains. But BERNARD is even more than that. He is gifted with the kindness of his dad, the laser eyes, and the bionic paw of his mother. That makes him a truly unique doggo. His barrel is full of $BERN, his essence, his blood.\r\n\r\nThe $BERN Tokenomics apply a special tax to every transaction of the tokens. 5% are redistributed back to holders while 5% are burned forever reducing the total supply which will cause a permanent token rarification. Several events will happen depending on the number of BERNARD fans"
