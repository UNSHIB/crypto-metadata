        "en": "A Decentralized Meme Token for PancakeSwap Fans Worldwide BeagleCake is a token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that rewards holders in CAKE providing a source of passive income for our investors. BeagleCake rewards holders automatically to their wallet in the form of CAKE rather than more tokens. RFI-Static rewards incentivize investors for holding tokens which leads to a vibrant ecosystem for all holders. Usually, tokens reward their holders with more of the project token. By offering CAKE as a reward our holders receive a token with proven steady growth while also holding a share in BEAGLE."
