        "en": "The BOS platform project was started in late 2016, and has undergone a major change in technical governance and direction in early 2018. From 2019, We intend to set our course to the original white paperat the time of the ICO with a new brand name called BOSAGORA.\r\n\r\nBOSAGORA came from the word \u201cBOS\u201d and \u201cAGORA\u201d combined together, which shows the true birth of democracy.\r\n\r\nBOSAGORA aims toward more democratic and productive decision-making process with a blockchain implementation."
