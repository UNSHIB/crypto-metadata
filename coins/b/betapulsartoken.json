        "en": "Polypulsar is a yield farming platform with PvE and PvP games. The platform aims to integrate block chains games with yield farming to offer a different yield farming experience. \r\n\r\nUsers can yield farm and play games with their earnings to try and get extra rewards, or sell them for a profit. Players are rewarded with native tokens as well as USDC each day if they are in top 20. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the project involves creating an MMORPG game with a sandbox ecosystem."
