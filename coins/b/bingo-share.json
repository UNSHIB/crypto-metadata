        "en": "Bingo Cash Finance is the AlgoStable coin protocol built on the Binance Smart Chain  for casino gaming. We are a fair launch project with no pre-sale, no investor, and no pre-mine. Ensuring that everyone is equal from the start.\r\n\r\nBingo Cash (BGO) is an algorithmic token that will seek to have its price stay as close to 1$ as possible.\r\n\r\nBingo Shares (SBGO) loosely represent the value of the Bingo Cash Finance and trust in its systemic ability to maintain BGO to peg. During epoch expansions (when TWAP - time-weighted average price of BGO is above the 1 $BUSD peg), the protocol mints BGO and distributes it proportionally to all SBGO holders who have staked their tokens in the boardroom.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, SBGO are used to achieved a completely decentralized on-chain governance where SBGO holders have voting rights and the ability to create proposals to improve the protocol."
