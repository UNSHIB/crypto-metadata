        "en": "BabyBitcoin (BBTC) aims to provide, through a transaction tax system, continuous benefits for the project holders. The tax system retains 5% of transactions, which corresponds to 3% that goes to liquidity and 2% that is distributed to holders (including the burn address).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the project is to collaborate economically (through token distribution) with different global organizations that work to alleviate child poverty (in the different axes derived from this problem).\r\n\r\nThe identity of the token is a memecoin, taking as a reference the father of all cryptocurrencies"
