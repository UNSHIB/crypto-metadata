        "en": "NFT and blockchain games have recently exploded in popularity. However, none of the games currently on the market truly embrace a fully decentralised ecosystem and complete on-chain experience, factors which should be the fundamental essence of blockchain gaming.\r\n\r\nBlockchain Monster Hunt (BCMH) is the world\u2019s first multi-chain game that runs entirely on the blockchain itself. Inspired by Pok\u00e9mon-GO,BCMH allows players  to continuously explore brand new places on the blockchain to hunt and battle monsters. Each block on the blockchain is a unique digital space where a limited number of monsters (of the same DNA gene and rarity) may exist.  Players and collectors can hunt or battle for a chance to capture these unique monsters and to earn coins."
