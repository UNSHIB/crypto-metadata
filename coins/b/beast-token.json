The Beast Token and team will be matching his weekly video views with airdrops to holders, his giveaways x10 to a single holder, and use transaction tax to buy Mr.Beast merchandise for holders as a way to donate to charity.\r\n\r\nThe Beast Token plans to start on the ERC20 network and then further expand into other networks such as MATIC and other current pioneers. The token also plans to allow more variety in donations and add more youtubers to their donation network in the future."
