        "en": "The issue and halving mechanism of BSHA3 are similar to Bitcoin. The currency uses the innovative algorithm SHA3d, which inherits the strengths of Bitcoin\u2019s SHA256d algorithm with iteration and optimization. BSHA3 is the first cryptocurrency using that algorithm while algorithm is the core of cryptocurrencies. It has no ICO and very little premining. JonLayton (ch4ot1c), the founder of the project, is an American developer and one of the developers of Bitcoin Core as well as ZCL and BTCP."
