Each time you want to make a withdrawal, Blank will create a new wallet address for you with the amount of crypto that you requested. This address originates from the smart contract where everyone\u2019s funds are pooled. All of this is achieved using cryptographic proofs to ensure that the user cannot be linked with the original depositing address."
