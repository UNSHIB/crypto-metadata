The blockchain experiment only started with the aim of utilizing blockchain technology in real life through research and development. The BSYS project promises that they do not talk about things that they have not done yet, and they want to talk only about the results and what they are making.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of the BSYS project is to focus more on implementation, wide experimentation, and sophisticated comprehension to achieve more realistic conclusions.\r\n\r\nBSYS CHAIN is the hybrid blockchain of possibly combining Bitcoin\u2019s ideal-decentralized system structure and usability of a centralized system. The structure allows businesses to easily connect with existing businesses while maintaining decentralized system and enabling the faster implementation of blockchain innovations in the real world. The advantages of hybrid blockchains are to be maximized through BSYS PAYMENT SERVICE. "
