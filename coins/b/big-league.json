        "en": "Big League (BGLG) will curate high-quality, limited-edition sports NFTs based on the most popular athletes in the world. These NFTs will show your favourite stars in action, even depicting them during some of the most famous and critical moments in sports history. Quality is always our priority, and it will never be compromised for quantity. In addition to creating its marketplace, Big League will also integrate innovative tokenomics that benefit those partaking in conserving the ecosystem, the community. Big League Token will act as the token of utility that allows the overall ecosystem and marketplace to function. Users will be able to trade BGLG for NFTs, along with trading NFTs and BGLG between each other directly or through a DEX. As the project continues developing along with its roadmap, further use cases will be explored, such as governance, yield farming."
