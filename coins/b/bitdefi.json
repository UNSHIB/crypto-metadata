Decisions made on the DeFiat network are voted on and fully orchestrated by BFi holders. Every time a transaction occurs on the network, a fee is distributed to network participants and tokens are burned to facilitate the transaction, naturally decreasing supply. Transaction fees are repurposed as staking rewards, creating a circular economy."
