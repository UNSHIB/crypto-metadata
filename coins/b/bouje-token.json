        "en": "A Yield Farm that aims to attain sustainable and steady price action. We have a cutting edge system, which is called APR reset (inspired from Swift Finance). This means that every week, the old non-native pools would be retired and replaced with new pools which the community decides. This is an amazing thing as it helps renew deposit fees which would be then directed to the natives again! Also then sustaining the farm for a much longer period of time."
