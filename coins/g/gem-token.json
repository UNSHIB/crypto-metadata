        "en": "Clam Island is a Gamified Yieldfarming and NFTs Platform with a 3D Island UI that guides the user with characters through the whole yieldfarming-investment process. It has a two-token ($SHELL and $GEM) and two-NFT (Clam and Pearl NFTs) ecosystem.\r\n\r\n$SHELL is the governance token of Clam Island (I applied for this token a listing as well shortly before this application). The only way in which its supply increases is by burning Clam NFTs.\r\n\r\n$GEM is the reward token of the yieldfarm. It is used on our platform to buy Clam NFTs by burning $GEM. Also when Pearl NFTs get produced by staking Clam NFTs 10 $GEM is used to produce the Pearl.\r\nLike $CAKE - $GEM has no maximum supply as it is a farmable token. This is why I put in \"\"999999999999\"\" in max supply below as I have to put in a number and \"\"unlimited\"\" supply can't be typed in."
