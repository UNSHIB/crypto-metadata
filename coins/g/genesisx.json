        "en": "GenesisX is a completely transparent blockchain. To that end, we produce budget documents on a regular basis which contains financial information about the pre-mine as well as information on funds raised in the pre-sale (BTC funds), and show how funds are being spent to steadily improve the project. \r\n\r\nMasternode governance is a cornerstone of GenesisX. Governance enables the community to be actively engaged with, and vote on, project developments. These community proposals may includes voting on items such as expenditures and where we allocate the funds to increase marketing, exchanges and listing."
