GoCerberus tokenomics is a hybrid between yield farming and Safemoon.\r\n\r\nEach transfer of CERBERUS must pay a 9% transfer tax. The 1% transfer tax gets added to the liquidity pool through the contract automatically to raise the price floor continuously. And the liquidity will be locked and inaccessible. And the rest 8% transfer tax will be burned immediately. The whole process is automatic."
