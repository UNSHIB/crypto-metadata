        "en": "Along with the need for a catalyst (the crystal eggs), a second key component to summoning heroes to this realm is a substance known as Gaia\u2019s tears. When Irae tore the world asunder in his rage, Gaia wept. Her tears took the form of small, dust-like crystals. Warm to the touch, her power flows through them, and it is said an ounce of them holds enough power to bridge the vast expanses created in Irae\u2019s fury. Gaia\u2019s tears can be found in small quantities throughout the kingdom, and the druids have recently discovered a means to harness them to summon others to these lands."
