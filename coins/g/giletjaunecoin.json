        "en": "The GiletJauneCoin (GJCO) was created to support the international movement of the \"yellow vests\" (also known as the \"Gilets Jaunes\" in the french press) in the legitimate struggle of the peoples to self-determination, and reconquest of their economic, territorial and monetary sovereignties.\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropean anti-democratic governments, supported by the European Union and the banking lobbies are restraining the citizens, keeping them in a system of endless debt circle, pushing the economies to chaos, currencies in a permanent inflation, and the most fragile of us in a growing misery. Therefore, it was critical to create a decentralized political and economical system based on a fairer, more equitable, and environment-friendly paradigm."
