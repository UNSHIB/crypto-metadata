With an aggressive roadmap in mind, we plan to be the one stop shop for all paranormal enthusiasts - starting with our NFT Marketplace dAPP and Evidence Submission Website with media player. We are actively building out the architecture for a 3d Marketplace and NFT Gallery dAPPS built on the Unity/Unreal game engine with the goal to create the premier Paranormal Metaverse - with $GREY as its native currency and utilizing community created and submitted NFTs to represent the unknown paranormal universe. We are all early."
