        "en": "Get Doge is a decentralized BEP-20 Token on the Binance Smart Chain designed to provide holders with Static Rewards in Dogecoin every 60 minutes. The token runs on a proprietary method that taxes each transaction on Buys/Sells and returns a 10% Dividend Paid in $DOGE Coin to its holders, which aims to offer scalability, as well as assisting Dogecoin in its growth.\r\n\r\nGETDOGE relies on the following principles: \r\n- 10% Dividend Paid in $DOGE Coin: Up to 10% of every buy/sell is redistributed to the $GETDOGE holders in the form of Dogecoin. Min 1 million tokens required.\r\n- Ever Increasing Price Floor: 2% of every transaction is transformed into liquidity for Pancakeswap. It's automatic and helps creates an ever increasing price floor (stability).\r\n- Buy Backs: GETDOGE uses 4% of transactions for auto-buybacks to maintain price stability.\r\n- Ever Increasing Price Floor: 2% of every transaction is transformed into liquidity for Pancakeswap. It's automatic and helps creates an ever increasing price floor (stability).\r\n- Anti-Bot Measures: Sniping bots are taxed 99% and the proceeds will be distributed as Dogecoin rewards and for the buy backs. GETDOGE is working with the Safe Launch team to combat bots.\r\n- Anti-Dumping Protocol: After each buyback, transaction fees for sells are doubled for 30 minutes, descending to the original rate with each minute.\r\n\r\n"
