        "en": "Glimpse is a social media network that utilizes Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's). Luckily, you don't need to know anything about NFT's to use our platform! If you can use TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube - you'll be able to use Glimpse just as easily!\r\n\r\nGlimpse allows people with large followings - think TikTok creators, Instagram Stars, Athletes, Celebrities, Artists etc. to upload pictures or short videos of their life and tokenize it in the form of an NFT. All this means is that this picture/video is 100% unique (only 1 in existence)!\r\n\r\nWith Glimpse, fans and followers can bid on their stars NFT's so they can own a unique moment of their life! Think about going to an athletic event where your favorite player scores the game winning point! Instead of listening to the recap like everyone else, you can bid on the video this athlete uploads to Glimpse where he talks about the intensity and excitement of that moment - and only you will own it! Like artwork - you can display this in your digital collection, re-sell it, or trade it for another NFT in the future!"
