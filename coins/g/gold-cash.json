        "en": "Our Mission is to make a rare cryptocurrency that is seen as a collectible coin for long term investment just like GOLD. That can be mined on your Home Computer. In uncertain times individuals, Business and Governments stockpile reserves of GOLD. However GOLD is difficult for small scale investors to purchase and store safely. This is the cryptocurrency alternative our Business model is designed for long term substantial growth. That offers stability in uncertain times. We plan to mirror Gold's demand and rarity by having a small max supply of coins, also a low block reward. Furthermore we plan to make partnerships with gold merchants in the hope that GOLD Cash could be exchanged for real physical Gold. We aim to reach this high goal in 2023. This would effectively make virtual cryptocurrency mining actual precious Metal mining.\r\n\r\nInvestors and miners are welcome to join the ever-growing friendly community built around GOLD."
