        "en": "GULAGToken is a community driven DeFi project fair-launched on Binance Smart Chain in July 2021. We aim to give holders the power to govern major decisions regarding the token and its development.  GULAG Token generates rewards to holders true tokenomics and static reflections. Rather than an additional tax on transactions, a locked charity wallet is set to hold 2.5% of the initial supply. The reflections this wallet receives will be donated, verifiable on the blockchain, and live streamed once a month. \r\n\r\n-11% of all transactions are redistributed to all holders. \r\n\r\n- 4% of all transactions are injected into the liquidity pool which will enable an increasingly stable price floor."
