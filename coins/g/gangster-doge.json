Tokens who want to be featured on the GANGSTER DOGE token site will need to pay to become partners and be promoted. The launchpad serves the purpose of weeding out illegitimate projects and confirming project activity with team leaders. \r\n\r\nIn review of projects that request to be partnered with GANGSTER DOGE, the executive board will research the project's team and past experience. Any projects found to be associated with projects that failed early will automatically be rejected, due to a poor track record. To uphold a high standard of coins that partner with GANGSTER DOGE, all requested projects will be asked to submit a record of previous experiences for each member on the project team. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, other factors will be taken into consideration that will decide whether or not a project will be accepted on the GANGSTER DOGE launchpad."
