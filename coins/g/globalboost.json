        "en": "GlobalBoost Coin is a cryptocurrency inspired by a combat wounded veteran as a way to easily crowd-source funding and raise money for wounded soldiers. It is a fork of Litecoin and has a 10% pre-mine. 50% of the pre-mined coins will be distributed to wounded soldiers on a tiered \u201cReach & Release\u201d timescale with a total payout of $100+ million to charity. The other 50% of the pre-mine will be used to develop an advertising platform.\r\n\r\nThere will be 1 billion GlobalBoost coins minted. A new block will be created every 30 seconds with a block reward of 95 coins. This block reward halves every 4 years. "
