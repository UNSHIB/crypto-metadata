        "en": "Art has always been one of the best investments throughout time mostly driven by the wealthiest segment of society \u2013 now accessible to everyone.\r\nBy tokenizing the painting, we can divide the painting into several virtual parts, parts that will be represented by tokens.\r\nWhen buying ARTG, you will be investing in the art without the complications that buying art pieces brings (place to store it, making sure it is genuine, a big investment, and so on) but keeping all the advantages.\r\nTraditionally, classic paintings do not lose value in bear markets and are even considered a refugee asset in times of crisis, making them a safe investment.\r\n\r\nARTG - Goya Giant Token. The first tokenized Goya painting in the world"
