        "en": "GRIM is a very special token and a labor of love for the community. GRIM enables users to effectively become a shareholder in the Grim Finance platform and receive a distribution equal to 50% of our platform harvest fee. Allowing users to earn rewards that grow directly along side us with our TVL.\r\nGRIM is designed to be deflationary, offering a competitive variable passive burn rate fee of (currently) 1%, and a 1% fee used to form GRIM-FTM. This allows users to gain value from passively holding the token."
