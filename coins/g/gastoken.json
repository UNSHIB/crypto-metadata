        "en": "GasToken is a new, cutting-edge Ethereum contract that allows users to tokenize gas on the Ethereum network, storing gas when it is cheap and using / deploying this gas when it is expensive. Using GasToken can subsidize high gas prices on transactions to do everything from arbitraging decentralized exchanges to buying into ICOs early. GasToken is also the first contract on the Ethereum network that allows users to buy and sell gas directly, enabling long-term \"banking\" of gas that can help shield users from rising gas prices.\r\n\r\nGas is a fundamental resource in the Ethereum network. Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees. Using GasToken on an eligible transaction, you can save money on the Ethereum network today.\r\n\r\nGas prices on Ethereum are hard to predict; they can be as cheap as 1 gwei or less at off-peak hours, while some transactions pay into the hundreds of gwei to buy into that juicy ICO or hit an order on EtherDelta before any other players. Users who need to be mined quickly or first often engage in fierce bidding wars, bidding wars in which using GasToken provides an enormous advantage by letting you perform the same transactions while spending less gas.\r\n\r\nCompounding this effect, Ethereum blocks are starting to fill up, making block space ever more coveted."
