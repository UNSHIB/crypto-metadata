        "en": "Goose Finance is a decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain and Pancake swap exchange, with lots of other features that let you earn and win tokens.\r\nWhat we are trying to do is create a perpetual deflation token, the Golden Egg, that allows a constant price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. We are not trying to replace the swap & exchange but to add value into the system and create a suitable and sustainable environment for people to yield farm with high APR."
