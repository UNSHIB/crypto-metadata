        "en": "Gomics intends to build a platform for writers and fans to take advantages of blockchain technology in the production and consumption of content. It is based on Ethereum \u2013 ERC20 token. Even if the works of artists and producers are supplied to the platform, their financial issues are very limited despite the rapid growth of the content market.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the writers and producers do not have a stable profit structure. It shows the reality of causing worse situation rather than resolving the conflict between the platform and the artists.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the distribution of illegal infringement threatens the livelihood of writers and producers, leading to financial losses. Gomics aims to protect the creative content of authors and creators with copyright protection technology, and to continue to produce good quality of content by providing them stable profit."
