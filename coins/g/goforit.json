        "en": "GoForIt Walk&Win is a geo-based mobile couponing platform. What does that mean? It means you can collect digital coupons, so called Goupons, out in the real world. But it is not quite as simple as that. You've got to put a little bit more effort into it because every Goupon is split into fractions which all have to be gathered and put together in order to cash it in. Gos can be placed anywhere around the globe, close to each other or spread all over the place. But don't you worry, the app will help you track them down. The map will show you where to find Gos."
