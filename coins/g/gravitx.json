        "en": "GRX is an elastic supply token build on the Binance smart chain, designed to rise by a minimum of 12% every 8 hours. That's the best rate of rise guarantee you can find ! \r\n\r\nHow does it work? \r\nAn elastic supply (or rebase) token works in a way that the circulating supply expands or contracts due to changes in token price.\r\nThis increase or decrease in supply works with a mechanism called re-basing. When a rebase occurs, the supply of the token is increased or decreased algorithmically, based on the current price of each token. In some ways, elastic supply tokens can be paralleled with stablecoins.\r\n\r\nThey aim to achieve a target price, and these re-base mechanics facilitate that. However, the key difference is that rebasing tokens aim to achieve it with a changing (elastic) supply. GRX differs by having an increasing peg price and no positive rebases, making GRX an AntiGravity upcoin. We called this new tech the AntiGravity Contract. "
