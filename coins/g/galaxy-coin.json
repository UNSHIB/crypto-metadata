        "en": "Galaxy coin is protocol built for Pancakeswap traders with a unique focus on making easy the concept of token reflection and liquidity. GalaxyCoin is a protocol everyone can understand.\r\nEvery trade contributes toward generating liquidity which is automatically locked inside Pancakeswap LP. 5% of every transaction is locked as liquidity in the Pancakeswap GLXC/BNB pool forever creating an ever rising price floor.\r\nGalaxyCoin will redistribute 5% of every buy & sell order back to GLXC holders passively [without the need to take any action]."
