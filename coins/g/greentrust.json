        "en": "GreenTrust Token (\u201cGNT\u201d) is a sustainable decentralized blockchain application that prides itself of being the first Utility Token with a carbon-neutral network.\r\nIts utility resides on its capability to allow users to reduce their individual carbon footprint by exchanging GNT for \u201cCO2 Offset Certificates\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe goal of GreenTrust Token is to contrast the carbon emission of the blockchain technology and promote sustainable energy use in cryptocurrencies' processes and applications. GNT believes that carbon neutrality can be reached by a commitment to measure, reduce, and finally offset carbon footprint. \r\nTo measure the GNT network carbon footprint, The \u201cGreenTrust Token model\u201d was developed. The model dynamically links the number of GNT transactions with the equivalent CO2 emission. \r\nTo reduce, and finally offset CO2 emissions, GNT team is committed to incept and accelerate initiatives along two main routes: Compensation and Reduction at the source.\r\n\r\nGreenTrust Token hence uses blockchain to align incentives of different stakeholders, developers and businesses towards green economy goals. It is based on the BSC-BEP20 network, with the consensus mechanism Proof of Staked Authority (\u201cPoSA\u201d) that ensures efficiency and performance in terms of speed and cost of transactions. The simpleness of the GNT contract, and the 0% fees policy, help in this sense, allowing users to transact GNT with a smooth IN/OUT process. The GNT smart contract was audited and verified by TechRate Audit company , passing all the checking status and without reporting security issues."
