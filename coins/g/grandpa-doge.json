        "en": "GrandpaDoge is a meme-based project about the oldest, but also wisest member of the Doge family. The token is deflationary itself as it has a 12.5% tax, of which 8% will go directly into the liquidity, 4% reflection to holders, and 0.5% to a team marketing wallet. The project also features anti-dump and anti-whale mechanisms with a 1.5% supply max transaction and 2.5% max wallet limitation. With these tokenomics, GrandpaDoge is here to compete with the rest of the family!"
