        "en": "Gatsbyinu is all about giving to the world and the community that evolves around it. Ever since launch the community that has formed around the token has been amazing and contributed to the growth of the token in many ways. We recognise the effort and have made an effort ourselves to offer rewards through community giveaways, competitions and participation contests. \r\n\r\nWith every successful project utility needs to be attached. Currently GatsbyInu is developing a limited amount of GatsbyInu NFTs, where more detailes will be revealed soon in our telegram community group. With this we plan to follow to develop more utility but, because the project is in its early stages we cannot reveal more details for now. \r\n\r\nThe GatsbyInu team is working hard behind the scenes and is on track to making a project that will be beloved by everyone as let's be honest it is based on Elon Musk's best and cutest doggo."
