        "en": "Ghostface Shiba is an ERC-20 token with a UNIQUE usecase and simple tekonomics.\r\n\r\nTrick or Treat Roulette is taking the next step by utilizing nft contracts that can be kept or burned for the prize funds. This is a pay to play concept. In order to be able to play you must hold a certain amount of GSHIB in your wallet.\r\n\r\nTrick or Treat roulette will only take stable coin as payment that way payouts are also made in stable coins, which in turn helps to preserve the Ghost Face Shiba chart as there will be no dumping of GSHIB tokens from the prize money won. Each prize is collected in the form of an NFT. Now you can decide to sell that NFT back to the contract for the prize shown, or you can keep your NFT and sell it on any Marketplace."
