        "en": "Jackr is a private, decentralized adult cryptocurrency which intends to solve the monopolization of the adult industry. Everyone taking part in our adult network will be rewarded with Jack tokens. By creating an all-new mining concept that rewards every content viewer/uploader/chatter with Jack Tokens, Jackr makes it possible for everyone to make money in the adult industry. Users would be able to acquire Jack Tokens through watching or uploading content on platforms that support \u201cAdult Mining\u201d. User would then be able to spend these tokens to hook up with an escort through Jackdistrict.io or just simply trade out your tokens on an exchange. Jackload.io and Jackchat.io will be the first-ever platforms that support adult mining."
