        "en": "NTR/e is a wholly decentralized bridge token created to provide liquidity and increased access to the Jointer syndication ecosystem and the primary JNTR token. Due to JNTR/e being decentralized, it has the ability to list on decentralized exchanges and participate in decentralized finance pools and swaps like Uniswap.\r\nJointer minted a total of 1,000,000 JNTR/e on the Ethereum blockchain, with 0% accessible to the team, founders, and investors. \r\nJointer will burn 100% of the relay token (the LP share that controls the pool) which will alimt Jointer to ever access that pool or change it.\r\nJointer will distribute more than 63% of the total JNTR/e minted or 630 JNTR/e to the top holders of Uniswap."
