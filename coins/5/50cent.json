        "en": "The main difference of 50C compared to other stablecoins is that instead of pegging to a dollar, 50C strives for half of that, being pegged to 50 cents. With the market volatility making waves on the price. 50C total supply will be adjusted accordingly every 6 hrs, through either increasing, halting or decreasing by an appropriate amount to keep the price at where it should be."
