        "en": "4ARTECHNOLOGIES LEADS THE ART BUSINESS INTO THE DIGITAL FUTURE.\r\n\r\n4ARTechnologies sets a new standard for the art world with the 4ARTapp. With the security and reliability of the blockchain as a foundation, we are bringing the mainly analog art market into the digital era, with the goal of making collectors\u2019 assets future-proof as the technical link between partners worldwide. This creates new perspectives and secures cultural and material values.\r\n\r\nToday it is perhaps easier than ever to produce works of art. Forgeries and imitations, works without sufficient history, scientific analyses or certificates of authenticity are part of the art market. They damage the reputation of art as a cultural asset and damage the market. The 4ARTpassport not only combines the unalterable recorded history of an artwork with its unique and always identifiable 4ARTdna, it also records every change of condition, every change of ownership and every transport in a digital, living provenance \u2014 for the present and future generations.\r\n\r\nThrough the symbiosis of state-of-the-art technological innovations, 4ARTechnologies creates the foundation for a uniform digital standard for the global art industry.
