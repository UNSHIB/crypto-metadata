        "en": "Amoveo (VEO) is a highly scalable proof-of-work blockchain driven by its community and aimed for prediction markets, investment and insurance contracts, and various derivatives, such as stable coins.\r\n\r\nAmoveo is a blockchain meant for enforcement of investment and insurance contracts.\r\n\r\nAmoveo contracts are enforced using state-channels. This means fees are low, contracts are nearly instant and can support a global audience.\r\n\r\nAmoveo has oracle technology. Amoveo can learn facts about our world and enforce the outcome of contracts that are governed by these facts. This, for example, enables you to bet on the price of Amazon shares.\r\n\r\nThe variables that define how to participate in Amoveo can be modified by the Amoveo community using a built-in process. This way Amoveo will always stay optimally tuned to produce the best results."
