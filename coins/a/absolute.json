        "en": "Absolute - Proof of Advertisement Views. Our unique Masternode-backed Smartcontracts affords trust in programmatic advertising. Efficiency. Before programmatic ad buying, digital ads were bought and sold by human ad buyers and salespeople, who can be expensive and unreliable. Programmatic advertising technology promises to make the ad buying system more efficient, and therefore cheaper, by removing humans from the process wherever possible. Our Smartcontracts for the first time ever decentralize this system to allow advertisers full trust in the way they spend their budgets."
