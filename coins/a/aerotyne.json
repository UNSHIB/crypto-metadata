        "en": "This is the first giveaway-centered, meme-based, reflective crypto token to be launching on the Binance Smart Chain. This meme is based off \u2018The Wolf of Wall Street\u2019, whereby the main character, Jordan Belfort, starts his journey through opening his own brokerage selling a penny-stock named Aerotyne International, which turned out to be a worthless company. This meme is very huge in the finance world, and especially in huge communities like r/wallstreetbets for example. We thought it\u2019d be ironic in a current state of shit-tokens being launched everyday if we created this one based off that meme, but with a genuine use-case and will be community-centered directly giving back to our investors and aiming to make our own decentralised platform to be the biggest out there, with massive marketing."
