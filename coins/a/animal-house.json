        "en": "AnimalHouse is a community rebuilt from the ground up. While our story may have started with a rug, that is not where it ended\u2014we fought back. Our animals have regained control of the AHOUSE contract, built out a team from within and beyond the crypto world, and have voted to proceed with projects that we believe will help people make money. \r\n\r\nFor Artists, By Animals NFT platform\r\nExpected to launch before Dec 2021 is the For Artists, By Animals NFT platform. This platform is designed for even-the-smallest artist to be able to mint their own NFTs and keep most of the profit or donate a portion to an artist development fund.\r\n\r\nWildlife Rescue Team\r\nAnimalHouse Wildlife Rescue Team was formed by volunteers in our community, and has begun the work of identifying trends in crypto scams. The goal of this team is to educate those in crypto so they can better identify and avoid scams. Their goal is to begin releasing educational content by the end of Jul 2021. \r\n\r\nAnimalHouse has an open-door policy for new members. We welcome you to our community and encourage new members to get involved with the project. Come build with us! https://t.me/AnimalHouseOfficial\r\n"
