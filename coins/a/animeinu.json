There will be a subscribe option, if you wish to get updates every time when our platform will detect a fraud scheme project. \r\nAlso, we have in mind to implement a feature where you can place your wallet address to check all the tokens that have been  airdropped without your approval, if they are a scam or real airdrop.\r\n "
