        "en": "Think about artificial intelligence that writing code for you and constantly learning. Describe the software and features you want to encode. The AI will serve you the software with hundreds of different visual options in a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nYou won\u2019t have to pay a hundred thousand dollars to get your custom software. The AI will encode your software for just a couple of hundred dollars. You won\u2019t have to wait months. The AI writes code fast, secure, and without a mistake.\r\n\r\nYou can describe a hunter and birds. You can tell the AI for if the hunter gets a more successful shoot, the level will be harder. Furthermore, you can define ad frequencies and placements with a simple interface. Select hundreds of different hunter and bird images and assign them advanced movements and effects on AI advanced interface. Tell how the birds will fall after being shot and all the other details. The AI will code all the details for you. If the AI doesn\u2019t find the right code for your project, it will research and learn. Thus, the AI will be smarter and advanced after each project."
