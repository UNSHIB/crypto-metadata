        "en": "For several years now, centralised finance has been struggling to attract the public, which has led to the emergence of new trading, savings and lending solutions through decentralised finance.\r\n\u200b\r\nNevertheless, it is clear that most of these solutions are expensive (high gas fees), energy-intensive and difficult to use.\r\n\r\nABLE Finance is a cost-effective and energy-efficient DeFi protocol designed to address these issues and offer a credible alternative to centralised finance."
