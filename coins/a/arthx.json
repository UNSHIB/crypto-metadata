        "en": "The ARTHX token is the third token in the MahaDAO protocol that allows the ARTH platform to scale efficiently. It is a special token designed to absorb the volatility of the ARTH token.\r\n\r\nARTHX is minted when a user decides to deposit collateral into the protocol to mint ARTH tokens. ARTHX is burned when a user decides to withdraw collateral from the protocol by burning ARTH tokens. \r\n\r\nARTHX besides having a utility within the ARTH ecosystem is also designed to be a deflationary token. When a user transacts with ARTHX by sending it from one wallet to another, a transaction fee is charged which is then redirected towards the staking pools or burnt off from the supply.\r\n\r\nThere is no max supply for the ARTHX token."
