        "en": "Acoin was designed from the ground up and is designed to be a rare currency. There is no premine. Only 800,000 to 1,600,000 coins will be issued (this varies due to the random rewards system). The coin reward starts at 1 and halves every 6 months. One in ten blocks will have a reward that is two to ten times the normal block reward.\r\n"
