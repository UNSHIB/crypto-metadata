        "en": "Atlantis is a decentralised money market that enables users to borrow and supply digital assets to the protocol within a non-custodial environment directly within the Binance Smart Chain. This means that users, at all times, have control of their digital assets and are bound by the protocol\u2019s parameters directly on-chain. The protocol is autonomous and algorithmic with its parameters being controlled by governance proposals and yield curves. "
