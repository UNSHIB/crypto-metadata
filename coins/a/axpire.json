        "en": "\"The aXpire mission of generating savings for clients is shaped by having 17+ years of experience in the software development space through their sister company LSG, or Legal Solutions Group, a company that has been creating and servicing \u201chousehold\u201d names such as Coca-Cola, Nike, IBM, Intel, KFC, NFL and beyond with legal software solutions that have saved clients $1.2 billion dollars in total.\r\n\r\nAs a company, aXpire was created as an offshoot of LSG in 2017 when a large top 10 global hedge fund needed a specific software solution. It was decided to separate aXpire as a new company, which then won the contract to supply this large global hedge fund with a custom, tailor-made fund software solution called \"\"Resolvr\"\".\r\n\r\nSince then, the company has built out a number of new solutions, including a legal billing software, an expense management software, and a cryptocurrency payments application for iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nThe AXPR token was launched on Ethereum (ERC20) and Binance Chain (BEP2) as an extension of aXpire in early 2018, with advisors Roger Ver, Mate Tokay, Shingo Lavine, and a host of other advisory board backers within the fund and legal industry spheres. The AXPR token is involved with all of aXpire's B2B and B2C products, with product fee discounts and more. It's most central aspect is the burn function, however, wherein 5% of all company revenues from fees, software sales, and beyond are used to buy and burn AXPR tokens, reducing supply.\""
