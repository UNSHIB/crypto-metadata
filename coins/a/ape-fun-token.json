        "en": "Ape Fun is an arts and entertainment project launching unique dApps (decentralized apps) with built-in marketplaces in the gaming, visual art and animation, music, and film industries where all in-dapp trading activity will be conducted in Ape Fun Tokens. Our broad focus is to bring new users into the blockchain space while giving gamers and artists\u2014across a broad spectrum of mediums\u2014an avenue to success within the blockchain space. \r\n\r\nOur first dApp (The Banana Kingdom, which launched in July 2021 ahead of the token itself) is a social network for gamers where players can create and manage their own eSports team or play to earn on APEX eSports teams. Users can also earn by completing Kingdom tasks, by staking and farming, or by entering contests for sold-out metaverse items like in-game land. \r\n\r\nApe Fun Magazine, a blockchain game-review e-mag will serve as a sister project to the Kingdom in the gaming industry and is launching in early Q4 '21 alongside our gamer-gorilla NFT project. Our standalone art-marketplace is the next dApp to be built in 2021 and will allow anyone to mint their own NFTs alongside our NFT launches. Q2 of 2022 will see the launch of a streaming NFT music app/marketplace and Q4 2022 will see a dApp launch in the film industry. Multichain support will also be added in 2022."
