        "en": "Ashera is a token that has existed before, yes it is Showshoe, the previous dev left us and left an important wallet. We also have the mint authority so the previous dev can't access the wallet. We with the new team decided to rebrand this token, we named it Ashera.\r\n\r\nWhy Ashera? Ashera is a hybrid of the Asian leopard cat, a domestic housecat. Personality-wise, it is LOYAL, AFFECTIONATE, and very INTELLIGENT. Ashera is the most prized pet cat in the world and you can take one home if you can cough up the astronomical price.\r\n\r\nAshera will provide some features that will help many Solana Developers, Ashera DEX, Dashboard Walle,  Ashera Tools, NFTs Marketplace. Discord Tip Bot, Discord Price Bot"
