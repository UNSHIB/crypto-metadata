        "en": "The main idea of our team is creating a full ecosystem with a lot of specific features, functioning on the decentralized exchange basis. That\u2019s why we issued our own token, which will be used also as tradable asset.\r\n\r\nur token is called AWC (Atomic Wallet Coin). A strict limit of 100 000 000 AWC will be created, never to be increased. AWC will run natively on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC20 and issued to regulate Atomic Wallet service prices in a decentralized and egalitarian manner. Atomic Wallet Coin is a universal method of payment for cryptocurrency listing in Atomic Wallet, Currency promotion or Swap Order interface placement.\r\n\r\nAWC token will be used to pay for different fees on Atomic Wallet platform, including but not limited to:\r\n1. Listing new assets in Atomic Wallet - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase integration within the Atomic Wallet for the AWC-tokens. The price of integration will be 100,000 AWC-tokens. It will be a great possibility for the new coins and tokens to become a part of Atomic Wallet ecosystem\r\n\r\n2.Listing new assets in Atomic swap exchange - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase integration within the Atomic Wallet swap exchange market for the AWC-tokens.
