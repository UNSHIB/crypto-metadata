        "en": "Astronaut is a protocol built for decentralizing the way which new projects and ideas coming to the BNB ecosystem raise capital. The platform allows cryptocurrency projects to raise funds by setting up a pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so called \u201cPools\u201d have a soft cap and a hard cap. NAUT native token holders can stake BUSD according to their pool \"weight\" and receive a guranteed allocation of the IDO."
