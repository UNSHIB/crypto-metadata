The Astra Transaction Fees allows future development of the project, funds the marketing, the support team and also supports a number of NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS around the world by allocating funds for huge Charitable Donations.\r\nAstra holders can volunteer to be a part of the Astra Team to ensure full transparency with the community which is a core value of a Decentralized System."
