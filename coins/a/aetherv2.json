        "en": "Aether is building a bridge between science and cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nExploration has been the basis of human development from the beginning. Only by exploring and surpassing limits the human race can reach its true potential. \r\n\r\nAether will travel to the limits of science and technology, directing his project and efforts to transform the impossible into reality. \r\n\r\nOur project is based on research, technology development, and the achieving of humankind primary dream. \r\n\r\nIn partenership with Arca Space, we helped with the testing and development of Arca Space ecological propulsion system (Ecorocket). The rocket will be launched in the second half of September. Moreover, on this occasion, Arca Space will launch Aether cryptocurrency in space.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEcoRocket is a three-stage orbital vehicle, with its first two stages fully reusable. The first two stages are using an environmentally friendly water- based propellant that will put the third stage at an altitude of 50km and a speed of 5,400km/h. The third stage, fuelled by RP-1 and High Test Peroxide, will then propel a payload of up to 10 kilograms into orbit."
