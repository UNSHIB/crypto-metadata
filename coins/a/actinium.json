        "en": "Actinium is more than a crypto currency. Actinium is a decentralized currency built on blockchain technology that aims to help bring crypto into every customer\u2019s pocket, every store, and be extraordinarily safe and easy to use. This can be achieved because Actinium is a Lightning Network supported coin that will allow instant transactions with near-zero fees, atomic swaps, and many of the numerous other 2nd Layer solutions. \r\n\r\nActinium is completely decentralized without premine and is not an ICO. It has proper mining support, mobile wallets, and hardware wallet integration. Actinium has all the needed features already activated to achieve Lightning Network compatibility. Actinium will not remain a blockchain-only cryptocurrency. The inevitable progress will deliver competing solutions to many problems on different layers."
