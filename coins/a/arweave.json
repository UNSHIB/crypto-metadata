        "en": "Welcome to the future of data storage\r\nA new data storage blockchain protocol based on a novel proof of access consensus mechanism that creates truly permanent data storage for the first time. Now data is finally permanent, low-cost, and truly censorship free.\r\n\r\nArweave has solved the millennia old problem of decentralised data availability.\r\nPay Once, Store Forever.\r\nArweave makes permanent data storage a reality for the very first time. As the $3 trillion data-storage industry is growing, the need for cheap, distributed, permanent data-storage on the blockchain has become an urgent necessity."
