        "en": "A not so long time ago in a crypto galaxy right here in our backyards, ANON INU (AINU) was born. Based on the testimonies from Devs that actually burned their wallets, AINU was mistreated his whole life. At first, Version 1 (V1) knocked him to the ground as the owner allegedly made a mistake and instead of burning the coins, sent them into liquidity pool. This made the price dropped dramatically. But also gave rise to the idea of Version 2 (V2), where supposedly all holders who made a loss in V1 received an airdrop for V2. For a week or so, everything looked great, people were excited, price had its ups and downs, which is quite normal in crypto. Telegram group grew everyday, Twitter account was active and gained new followers on a daily basis."
