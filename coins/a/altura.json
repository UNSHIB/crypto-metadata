        "en": "What Is Altura (ALU)?\r\n\r\nIn-game items are a big part of any videogame and allow gamers to own digital assets. However, in-game items are centralized, not easily exchangeable, and challenging to implement. Altura is a smart contract platform that allows game developers to mint, distribute and transact Smart NFTs representing in-game items. Smart NFTs are NFTs with dynamic properties that can change based on certain conditions. Smart NFTs are the next step to making decentralized in-game items mainstream and offer a massive range of potential opportunities that are not possible with traditional NFTs. We want to create an easy-to-use interface and API for creating Smart NFTs, an open marketplace for transacting NFTs using the Altura token, and we want to introduce truly random smart loot boxes to the blockchain.\r\n\r\nAltura is creating:\r\n\r\nA marketplace for buying, selling and sending NFTs\r\nA user interface for creating smart NFTs\r\nLoot boxes that drop NFTs and a way to create loot boxes\r\nAPIs and SDKs for video game integration\r\n\r\nALU is the native utility token that is used for:\r\n\r\nTransactions on the Altura NFT marketplace\r\nGovernance and determining the direction of the platform"
