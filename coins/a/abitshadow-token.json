VR/AR is recognized as the next-generation general-purpose computing platform. ABST will assume the important task of promoting the virtual reality industry's ecological development and accelerate the advent of the VR/AR era. ABST will solve three major problems in VR applications: trust mechanism, equity distribution and content circulation: The ABST protocol, built on the basis of non-mutability, solves the trust problem in the virtual world and will become the cornerstone of the user relationship in the ABST virtual world. The decentralization setup allows any user to create a reasonable distribution of benefits in the ABST, whether producing contents or providing services; ABST l is a large ecology of virtual reality content. It will stimulate active behavior through unique ecological mechanisms and enhance the circulation of content.
