        "en": "Alpha Wolf Finance is a token launched on the Ethereum network which plans to encompass a wide range of assets, with goals to augment the crypto space and integrate it into the real world. Founded to give back to the community and care for the world around us, current use cases encompass NFTs for wildlife conservation and future utility in the entertainment and finance industries. The team at Alpha Wolf strives for transparency and commitment. To uphold these values and prevent overpromising/underdelivering, all projects we have planned will remain undisclosed until we are 100% committed and know we can deliver. We believe that the community is one of the most important parts of any token, and in that regard will be working with you to make this project the best it can be. With that said, we hope that you can join the wolfpack and help us create a better crypto space one project at a time."
