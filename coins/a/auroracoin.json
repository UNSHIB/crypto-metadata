        "en": "Auroracoin is a cryptocurrency for Iceland that is launched in February 2014. It is 50% premined and the coins will be distributed free-of-charge to all 330,000 citizens of Iceland via an airdrop starting from the midnight of 25th March 2014.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin is created as an alternative to the Icelandic krona. The movement of krona is severely restricted by the government and its value has dropped significantly against gold and the dollar since 1960. Each Icelandic national will receive 31.8 auroracoins during the airdrop.\r\n\r\nThe creator of auroracoin goes by the pseudonym Baldur Friggjar Odinsson. Aurorcaoin is a clone of <a href=\"/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>."
