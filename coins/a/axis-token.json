        "en": "The AXIS Utility token serves as an API access key for the blockchain ecosystem. It also facilitates transactions and access to data, and is used as a vehicle to run applications. For example, if a carrier wants to check on a proof of pickup he needs to access the database/blockchain, and will submit fractions of an AXIS Token to do so. Similarly, a Shipper would submit fractions of a token to validate documents and deliveries."
