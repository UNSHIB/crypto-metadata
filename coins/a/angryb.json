Angryb is a deflationary cryptocurrency asset, with a first-of-its-kind, zero-risk, half-price reservation mechanism. The successful transaction funds are attributed to smart contract and will be open source for the community.

The fair token attribute and asset protection mechanism will help Angryb community build a strong consensus and a large base of community members."
