It drives the next generation of projects to launch in an equitable and decentralized manner across multiple blockchains.\r\nLaunchX is community-driven, governance-based, and transparent. Our community runs LaunchX through a first-of-its-kind DAO protocol, so you can actually engage with the projects to dictate how they are launched (and if they will get launched at all)."
