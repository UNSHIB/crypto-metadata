Transform the way humans collaborate with technology that puts people in control of their data, money, and assets. \r\n\r\nDesigned specifically for Speed and Privacy, Lightstreams is a fast Ethereum-based blockchain with instant settlement and private distributed content sharing. Lightstreams makes it easy for developers to create applications emphasizing individual data ownership so that users are self-sovereign (i.e. they control access to their personal data).\r\n\r\nLightstreams applications are cross-compatible with Ethereum making it easy for developers to migrate and upgrade their decentralized applications to be fast, scalable and private. \r\n"
