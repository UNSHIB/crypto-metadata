        "en": "Lotto Nation is a first-of-its-kind, decentralised lottery platform run on the blockchain and powered by A.I, that allows companies, charities, and individuals to set-up their own lottery and connect with players through the most reputable and acknowledged technology.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to become the best fully licensed blockchain lottery in the world and we\u2019re in the first step of bringing our vision to life with the new generation of lottery built on the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\nLotto Nation allows any person or organisation to create and run their own lottery and invite friends, family or members to become part of a syndicate (a group of participants). By applying a social aspect to playing the lottery we will attract a new customer segment and become the main provider for privately run lottery syndicates. We will digitalise and revolutionise the social aspect of playing the lottery, and introduce systematic, decentralised and autonomous modules thanks to fair and secure blockchain protocols."
