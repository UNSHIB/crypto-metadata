It aims to simplify the process of resolving agnostic DID mechanisms by integrating DID standards into a modularized identity service.\r\n\r\nThe Litentry mobile application serves as a secure vehicle for users to collect their decentralized identities and manage them in one place. \r\n\r\nLIT token holders are also able to participate in on-chain governance in an efficient and secure manner."
