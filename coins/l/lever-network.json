Lever Network does not take custody of tokens and is only a peer to peer marketplace for lenders and borrowers. Lever Network uses partner exchanges (Uniswap and Sushi Exchange) for placing a trade. There is a gas delegation fee which the platform might charge on some or all of the transactions. This is only to reimburse the relayers the charge of relaying the transaction onto the blockchain."
