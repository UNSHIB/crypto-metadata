        "en": "The goal of Leafcoin is to make the world a better place. \r\n\r\nCurrently more than 80,000 est. acres of rainforest are destroyed daily this is about 60,500 american football fields. Imagine that. \r\nThese forests are the lungs of our world and we owe it to our future generation and the species living in the rainforest to preserve it. \r\nWe will sponsor re-forrestation of the rainforest by a yet to be developed foundation. Preferably we will use trusted partners, selected by the community, to assist us.\r\n\r\nAlso, generating cryptocurrency, as we all know, causes a lot of pollution because it uses quite dramatic amounts of electricity. \r\nCO2 is pumped into the air daily because we are all mining cryptocurrencies. By giving back to nature, esp. the rainforests, we hope to partially level that out.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are in the process of building a foundation where crypto-users can donate cryptocurrency, not limited to leaf, however leaf 'fourleaf' will be its leading symbol."
