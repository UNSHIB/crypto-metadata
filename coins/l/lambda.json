        "en": "Lambda is a fast, safe, and scalable blockchain infrastructure project, which provides decentralized applications (DAPPs) data storage capabilities with unlimited scalability and fulfills services such as multi-chain data co-storage, cross-chain data management, data privacy protection, PDP, and distributed intelligent computing through logic decoupling and independent implementation of Lambda Chain and Lambda DB.\r\n\r\nThrough the logical decoupling and separate implementation of Lambda Chain and Lambda DB, we provide infinitely scalable data storage capabilities to decentralized applications and achieve Multi-chain data cooperative storage, cross-chain data management, data privacy protection, data ownership proof, distributed intelligent computing and other services. Additionally, as the underlying service of blockchain, Lambda Chain provides millions of requests per second (RPS) through Sharding technology, which can grow as the scale of the system expands; and it also offers technology service capabilities for future unlimited expansion through sub-chain technology.\r\n\r\nWe believe that all storage projects follow the core requirement of Provable Data Integrity.Also, it is crucial for data projects to store data in an infeasible storage node and make them trusted and secure, in the academic world, there are mainly two approaches which are Provable Data Possession (PDP) and Proofs of Retrievability (POR) depending on the usage scenarios. Lambda has applied these two approaches in blockchain through academic research and engineering verification, which has eliminated the core obstacles of decentralized storage.\r\n\r\n"
