Instead of having users pay for a subscription, exposing them to terrible ads, or selling data, we've designed a number of activities on the platform will be incentivized. \r\n\r\nUsers will earn points for every milestone on the app. These points can be converted to Lunr tokens upon reaching certain thresholds."
