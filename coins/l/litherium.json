        "en": "Litherium is creating a currency model that subverts the world, allowing small-capital investors to subvert the traditional asset investment in the rising lithium concentrate. Investors do not need to bear the risks and technical issues of traditional futures assets such as holding, transfer, trading, storage, etc., and only need to invest in Litherium to complete the equivalent investment in new energy consumable lithium concentrate."
