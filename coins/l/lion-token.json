        "en": "Lion Token is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building based on the Huobi Eco Chain, Binance Smart Chain, and GateChain. The total amount of LION Token is 20 billion and it automatically destroys one-thousandth of each transaction done for deflation. 5 Billion tokens have been sent to the LION/HT liquidity pool on the Huobi Eco Chain Heco for global users to exchange fairly and justly from 0. 5 billion tokens have been released on the Binance Smart Chain BSC, of which 50 million have been released in the LION/BNB liquidity pool for global users to redeem from 0 at a unified time, and 50 million have been airdropped to Twitter/Telegram community users. 4.9 billion pieces entered the mining pool for global users to mine. the other 10 billion tokens will be released on the GateChain and on the main chain that is recognised by the community in the future."
