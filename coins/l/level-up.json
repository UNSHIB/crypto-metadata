The state-of-the-art launchpad will allow token creators to launch contracts using the project's ecosystem, providing revenue streams that will trigger buy-backs, effectively boosting holder profits.\r\n\r\nThe tokenomics include an 8% ETH reflection for each transaction that gets distributed automatically to all wallets holding the LVLUP token. There is also a 4% tax on all transactions that goes to a publicly notated Development Team wallet, totaling 12% tax for all transactions.\r\n\r\nFuture plans for the project also include adding a sports betting section to the Level Up platform in Phase Two plus an NFT Marketplace, within the Third Phase, that will allow holders to get even more rewards through weekly NFT giveaways.
