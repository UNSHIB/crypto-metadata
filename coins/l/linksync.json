        "en": "LinkSync aims to solve one of the biggest problems related to the rapidly emerging crypto markets by creating a workaround for the old fashion Chart tools, bringing security and transparency to the blockchain.\r\nLinkSync is going to offer access to all chains on the blockchain and by using LinkSync web or app you will be able to explore all blockchains charts, but you will also gain access to features like wallet track, known pump and dump whales track, and you will be able to scan and verify a contract, receive exclusive access to new and legit projects that will be launched through Linksync's launchpad platform.\r\nLinkSync Token is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum circulating supply of 1Q (quadrillion) on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, that involves an inaccessible burn wallet. \r\nDepending on each holder\u2019s percentage of ownership, a 12% transaction tax is distributed among all holders\u2014this includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes, a supply and demand model. There is no limit of how many tokens can be burnt. Without a burning limit, holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure!"
