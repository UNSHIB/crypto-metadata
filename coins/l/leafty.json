        "en": "LEAFTY is a fully decentralized community-led project where fees contribute to the environment. Each transaction is taxed for 11% of its total value. 1% will be redistributed amongst all LEAFTY holders. While the other 10% is donated to non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nWe only choose to donate to famous non-profit organizations that have proven to actively help our planet's environment. While feedback from the community is appreciated. For security reasons and to keep the trust of every holder we will never accept a non-profit environmental organization that has not been established for a long period of time as a candidate to receive the donations. \r\n\r\nThe other goal is to create awareness through smart partnerships with famous stars that line up with our vision. LEAFTY launched in September 2021 announced with Luis Suarez a famous football athlete and the first one to help us create awareness. By bringing the attention of the masses we will be able to generate larger amounts of donations that can achieve great progress in healing the environment.  \r\n"
