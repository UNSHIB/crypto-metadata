        "en": "Labra is a deflationary meme token. Every holder is staking automatically. The staking reward comes from transactions. 1% of every transaction goes to holders and 1% of every transaction gets burned immediately.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to have a true competitor for Doge but smarter. Incentivizing holders and burning 1% on every transaction makes it more fun. There is a serious team behind Labra and 70% of the maximum supply has already been burned.\r\n\r\nLabra is short for ''Labrador Retriever''. Which is the most popular dog in the whole world. The ticker that is being used is $LABRA. So it easily recognizable. \r\n\r\nAll initial liquidity has been locked and 70% of the maximum supply is burned. The maximum supply is 1,000,000,000,000,000. But now only 30% remains in circulation with everyday 1% of every transaction is getting burned. This means it is truely deflationary. \r\n\r\nWhat do we want to achieve?\r\nWe want to be the most fun meme token in the crypto space. Which is hard to achieve because of $doge position. But with a smart strategy, we are aiming for the moon. \r\n\r\nWho is behind Labra Finance?\r\nLabra Finance is developed by a group of DeFi enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nWhat is next for Labra Finance?\r\nThe team is focused on getting visibility first before reaching out to exchanges. The marketing machine has already been started by the Team."
