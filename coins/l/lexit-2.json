        "en": "What Is LEXIT (LEXi)?\r\n\r\nLEXIT is a full service #NFT & DeFi platform that tokenizes, launches and enables trading of intellectual property rights from Arts and Inventions. The platform will allow anyone who owns the copyrights to art, movies, TV Shows, characters, patents and technical inventions or Collectibles to mint and launch NFTs and have these immediately in liquidity on the integrated LEXIT DeFi Pools.\r\n\r\nLEXIT brings NFTs to DeFi by offering a decentralized finance platform where users can submit their intellectual property and mint tokenized NFT versions of their artwork, music, etc. These NFTs will then be launched through the LEXIT NFT Launchpad to the general public.\u2028\r\n\r\nNewly minted NFTs will be promoted as an initial NFT offering through LEXIT\u2019s NFT Launchpad. The NFTs will then be available for direct purchase or added by LEXIT pool Managers to various DeFi pools on the platform.\u2028\r\n\r\nAnyone owning intellectual property rights (IPR) to their artwork, music, film/videos, inventions, etc. may submit a listing for approval on the platform free of charge. If approved, the IPR enters the NFT Launchpad as an NFT client.\u2028\r\n\r\nThe NFT offering will be available on the NFT client\u2019s scheduled launch day to pre-subscribed LEXIT platform users who must perform social media tasks on behalf of the NFT client to increase the popularity of the offering.\u2028\r\n\r\nThe NFT then becomes available for direct purchase on the NFT Launchpad to then be available on the LEXIt DeFi Liquidity Pools, which are curated portfolios of various NFTs available on LEXIT. Pools are managed by pool managers and are open to everyone to join. \u2028\r\n\r\nLEXIT pools allow users to participate in potential high yield token pools. Anyone can become a pool manager and create a LEXIT DeFi Pool. Pool managers define the total liquidity and choose a variety of NFTs from the LEXIT marketplace. The pool manager must stake 5% of the pool liquidity to add \u201cskin in the game.\u201d Liquidity can be provided with popular tokens such as BTC, ETH, BNB and the LEXi coin among others trading pairs. \u2028\r\n\r\nLEXIT will also be coming out with its own Protocol, which we are currently far in development with & will call it the LEXNET. The LEXNET is a high performance Blockchain, which is fully compatible with Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain Protocols. First tests predict a Hash-Rate of at least 32000 TPS and further scalability. \u2028\r\n\r\nLEXi is the native utility token that is used for:\r\n\r\nLEXi is a utility token that is used for participation on LEXIT NFT Launchpad, LEXIT DeFi liquidity pool and in the LEXi Coin Community Staking .\r\n\r\nLEXi components include: \r\n\r\n* An NFT launchpad allowing users to tokenize and showcase their Intellectual Property as NFTs\r\n* LEXNET - an Ethereum-capable Protocol, with capacity far higher than stock Ethereum blockchain technology \r\nSame as above\u2028\r\n\r\nHow Many LEXi Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nLEXIT is launching its LEXi Coin on May 19, 2021 via IDO on the www.BSCPAD.com Launchpad with 1,110,000 LEXi tokens at initial circulation, in detail:\r\n\r\nTotal Supply (capped forever)        16,000,000 LEXi\r\n\r\nwww.BSCPAD.com IDO                650,000 LEXi\r\nAdvisors & Partners                200,000 LEXi\r\nLEXIT Liquidity                        320,000 LEXi\r\n\r\nTotal liquid circulation                1,110,000 LEXi\r\n\r\nAll Pre-Sale backers are subject to a Lock-Up and additional linear vesting. All LEXi Coin are minted as of this day and ready for distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of LEXIT?\r\n\r\nLEXIT was founded by Amir Kaltak (Founder, CEO), Katia Zaitsev (Co-Founder, CBO) and Frederik Prins (Co-Founder, COO). LEXIT started as a project back in 2016 where Amir was trying to monetize on his IPR from tech he created to fund a new idea. He then immediately realized that there is no such place where he can do that,  that was when the idea of LEXIT was born. \r\n\r\nHe instantly thought - what if it were possible to tokenize IPR and make it widely available via a Blockchain ? The idea grew & evolved into the next logical step - a protocol that had the needed performance and flexibility, our LEXNET is the result. Now all that was great but it would be even better if our user could easily access liquidity and so Ferhat (CTO), Frederik and Katia worked hard to figure out how it could be possible, the LEXIT DeFi Liquidity Pools were born. This is us, an powerful NFT Launchpad with integrated DeFi Liquidity on a novel LEXNET Protocol.\r\n\r\nAmir is a serial entrepreneur with 25+ years of experience who began coding at 7 years old. Katia specializes in Business development, Growth in Revenue, Corporate partnerships - with vast experience in growing revenue & developing businesses across various industries. Fredrik is in charge of Operations with vast experience in Banking & executive recruiting. While Ferhat, our CTO is a full-stack crypto Developer who began Bitcoin mining in Europe. One of the first. \r\n\r\nWhere Can I Buy LEXIT (LEXi)?\r\n\r\nPancake\r\nBitmart"
