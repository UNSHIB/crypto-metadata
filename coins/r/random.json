        "en": "Random is a deflationary token that will serve as the principle currency of Fractal Studios' multi-platform ecosystem. Projects currently in development include Lexicon, a digital trading card game and a random NFT generator & marketplace.\r\n\r\nAll transactions are charged with a 3% fee. 2% go to the distribution wallet and 1% get burned. In a nod to Chaos Theory, the project sets itself apart by dropping an indeterminate amount of RNDM into holders' wallets once a month."
