        "en": "Ronin Games is building a platform to bring together the best aspects of Crypto, Gaming, NFT\u2019s and Betting. The RONIN token will serve as the native utility token on the platform, being used for, but not limited to, interacting with the games by purchasing upgrades and NFT\u201ds, betting, voting/governance, staking, and more. In the initial phase of the Ronin Games platform development, the token will be subject to a tax which will be used to fund marketing, development and added to the liquidity pool. Once the platform goes live, all the taxes will be removed in their entirety. Ronin Games is currently engaging with several partners in the gaming industry and will be developing high-quality, high-resolution games never seen in the NFT and crypto gaming sector. We are also developing a range of so-called hyper casual games."
