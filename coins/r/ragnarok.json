        "en": "Ragnarok is a cryptocurrency that is dramatically faster, cheaper with multi-wallets, encrypted messaging, low number of confirmations, and more scalable than Bitcoin, it also a decentralized network of Masternodes without superfluous control and intermediaries/gatekeepers with pure PoS Block reward phase that will be shared between POS and MN to secure transaction on the network . Since the Masternodes are constantly connected to the network & perform certain tasks, this allows the coin to achieve faster and more private transactions."
