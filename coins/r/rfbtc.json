        "en": "RFbtc aims to increase profitability for token holders using RFI's tokenomics based around a 4.2% transaction fee where half is distributed to all token holders automatically and half is sent to a burn address, deflating the total supply. All generated fees that do not get burned go to holders of the token based on what percentage of ownership they have of RFbtc. "
