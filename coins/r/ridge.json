The concept of RIDGE is based on a blockchain technology that is decentralized and uses smart contracts for transactions.\r\nDeveloped with an idea of giving back to the community and to establish a genuine relationship with holders. RIDGE places a huge priority on charity which will assist children, sick people, young talented individuals, smart and creative developers and also victims of rug-pulling and crypto scams etc.\r\n\r\nThe token economy will be driven by strong community influence and will involve manual burns of tokens and burns by community voting power respectively. Also, as a community based token, destinations for donations will be determined by community voting power."
