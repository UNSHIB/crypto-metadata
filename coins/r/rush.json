        "en": "Rush is an ERC-20 token backed by aggregate quarries to provide stability that is not common among cryptocurrencies. While other assets are prone to market volatility, Rush can establish a stable price due to being backed by a consistently valued asset.\r\n\r\nRush is a mintable ERC-20 token which enables the creation of new tokens to be added to the currency\u2019s max supply, while the supply of other ERC-20 tokens is fixed. This function opens up a range of very promising possibilities for Rush tokens."
