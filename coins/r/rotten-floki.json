The Rotten token uses the BEP-20 standard, but will support ERC-20 once cross-chain is deployed. The platform runs on a standard backend operating on AWS with logs being stored on Elasticsearch. Each in-game asset is hashed and deployed on the blockchain using a smart contract to ensure full ownership.\""
