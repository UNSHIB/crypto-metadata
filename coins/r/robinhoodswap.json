        "en": "The objective of RobinHoodSwap is to allow users to utilize blockchain and DeFi to earn rewards while contributing to society by giving back to charitable organizations. It is indeed a platform where prosperity meets charity to create a better society. As you farm, rewards are generated which are then attributed to give back to charity. \r\nAs DeFi has gained immense popularity over the years, it has created a unique opportunity to channel the reward flow of liquidity provisioning as well as staking into something meaningful. As a singular entity, achieving such a goal can be daunting. But strength in numbers, while every single participant in the ecosystem stands to benefit - that is an exponential benefit.\r\n\r\nRobinHoodSwap will achieve its vision with its governance and utility token, called \u2018RBH'. RBH will firstly be used to stake in order to earn rewards, while enabling developers to earn a slight percentage of those rewards to further push forward the goal,  giving back to charitable causes via the blockchain and DeFi."
