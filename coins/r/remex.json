        "en": "Agafos LLC has been operating on the Georgian market since April 2020.\r\nToday, the Agafos team consists of 14 members who are qualified in management, development, and marketing.\r\n\r\nRemeX is a token introduced by AGAFOS - a project lead by enthusiastic team aimed at making online marketing creative and fun. Using blockchain technology the team is building a decentralized user-generated system that makes ads pleasant and resourceful.\r\nTaking into account the bad consequences of most presales that happened recently, we decided to cancel presale and fill the Liquidity Pool on a private sale.\r\nParticipants of the Private sale are team members and backers who believe in the project and therefore are interested in its long-term investment. In addition, all of us have a limit of 25% quarterly to sell tokens. It creates a very strong basis for the development of the token."
