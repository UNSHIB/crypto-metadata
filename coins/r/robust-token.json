        "en": "Robust Token (RBT) is an original concept token on the Binance Smart Chain with a limited supply of 100 000 RBT and a 1% burn per transaction that gets converted into Robust Reward (RBW).\r\n\r\nThe Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem is flooded with thousands of tokens with quadrillions in total supply and numerous zeros.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the RBT tokenomics is designed with an extremely limited supply, rigid deflationary mechanism, a loyalty reward system, and a solid roadmap of future developments.\r\n\r\nRBT is audited by Techrate and added to Trustwallet."
