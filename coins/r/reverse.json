We use the blockchain to verify and prove that. Track your own, verifiable data. Clean and Simple.\r\n\r\nReverse token uses reflection to transform a percentage of the transaction into funding carbon removals. Initially, the funds will be used on existing projects, but in time, they will fund innovative solutions in the future such as kelp reforestation and food, feed and fertilizer projects. This will decrease the current cost of carbon removals and increase positive impact on climate change per dollar spent.\r\n\r\nDo good, get rewarded. As long as you\u2019re holding RVRS you\u2019ll receive rewards. You receive additional tokens from reflection - no need to stake! There will be NFT rewards related to your positive impact on the environment."
