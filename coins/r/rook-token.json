        "en": "r0ok originated as r0ok Clothing Co, founded by Ty Campos, a clothing company dedicated to spreading mental health awareness. Because he is involved with the crypto community, he decided to create $R0OK to create a bridge between the two communities, while offering the same morals and principles that are behind r0ok Clothing Co. \r\n\r\n$R0OK was created as a charity token that has two main purposes.\r\n1) To give the community a token they can have complete trust and faith in.\r\n2) To create a steady source of donations for the mental health community that stem from the crypto space.\r\nBy simply buying and holding $R0OK, you are helping an important part of the bigger cause by helping create awareness for a worldwide epidemic."
