An internet where we can preserve the human right to privacy. An internet where we can freely transact without middlemen, and ultimately take back control of our digital identities.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still just the beginning, but the promise of Web 3.0 and TRON Foundation is here to stay. Reyna aims to be a window into this new world. We believe browsers to access the TRON Foundation network should be completely decentralized, and without centrally imposed restrictions.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re excited to introduce the Reyna Foundation \u2014 our small contribution in facilitating the trend towards a more open internet, and our next step towards Reyna being self-governed by its own users.\r\n\r\nIn the outline below we present a utility token for the Reyna application, the Reyna 2 Token (\u2018REY2\u2019), and the details of our Contribution Period slated for December 12th 2019.\r\n\r\nREY2 will be used to power the Reyna Client, including:\r\n\r\nAnonymous messenger.\r\nDecentralaized exchange.\r\nBlockchain explorer.\r\nReyna Foundation.\r\nGambling, Casino.\r\nCryptocurrency Exchange Platform.\r\nConvenient, affordable and secure online travel service.\r\nCryptocurrency wallet."
