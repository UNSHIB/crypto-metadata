        "en": "HodlADA is a frictionless yield token to give the highest rewards generated by any token on the Binance Smart Chain. By just simply holding $HodlADA, investors yield a generous passive income paid out in ADA.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nHodlADA tokemonics works by taking a tax fee on every transaction. 6% of each buy fee and 8% of each sell fee is redistributed to every wallet that holds $HodlADA on a percentage basis. Each holder will secure a generous passive income in the form of ADA.\r\n\r\nHow can I claim my ADA?\r\nIt will be automatically sent to your wallet. All you need to do is simply hold and you\u2019ll receive a passive income."
