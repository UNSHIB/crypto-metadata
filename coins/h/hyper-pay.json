        "en": "HyperPay is a revolution for the system of accessing, exchanging and transacting funds for both users and service providers. The separation of digital currency wallets and third-party payment platforms is an inconvenience that more people are experiencing by the day. HyperPay will enable users to better organise their financial lives and gain greater control of their payment options by combining transaction methods into a single gateway with agility and security unlike any other wallet."
