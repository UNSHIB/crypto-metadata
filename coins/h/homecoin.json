The first leg of growth is from the RuufPay Wallet, a mobile application being designed with a simple user interface for landlords and tenants to collect and pay rent with RuufPay's native token, Home Coin, in a seamless fashion. Users will be able to stake Home Coin in the mobile wallet and apply staking rewards directly towards rental payments, giving them a discount on their monthly rent."
