        "en": "Hugo is a community driven project where the token will be a governance for the upcoming platform. Hugo holders will be auto-staking once they hold because of the distribution mechanism. At every transaction a 2% fee is charged, 1% is burned and 1% is distributed to all Hugo holders. This means that the token is deflationary. The main features and platforms for Hugo will be the DAO platform (for voting), NFT platform and a crypto index fund composed by the community."
