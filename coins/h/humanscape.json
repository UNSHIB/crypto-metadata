        "en": "\"Humanscape is a decentralized patient network based on blockchains. Humanscape can provide practical help for patients to overcome their diseases through intellectual and emotional interaction with each other based on community activities. \r\n\r\nThis process is expected to generate and collect a high volume of patient data, namely PGHD, on various disease groups in our data hub. Furthermore, Humanscape facilitates active research into incurable diseases and the development of new drugs by linking patients to external industry sectors such as pharmaceutical firms and research institutes and helps patients to avoid complications and enjoy healthy lives through the continuous self-management of their lifestyle and symptoms. \r\n\r\nData being stored on blockchain, no third party can monopolize health data and profit made out PGHD will be returned to patients.\r\n\r\nWith these services, Humanscape is taking steps to liberate patients from incurable diseases, as its contribution to a world where everyone is healthy.\""
