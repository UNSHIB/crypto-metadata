        "en": "Hungry Bear is a deflationary, fully audited and community-driven BEP-20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It was launched on April 12th 2021. Two functions occur during each trade: Reflection and Burn.\r\nAccording to the UN, 25,000 people die each day from hunger or related causes. Hungry bear has for noble mission to solve this issue as well as helping in the conservation of endangered species.\r\nProviding relief for the economically disadvantaged benefits humanity in many more ways. With this primary need already fulfilled, people would be able to focus on growing and leading a worthy life.\r\nThe philanthropic aspect of Hungry Bear is a founding pillar as to why we started this cryptocurrency project. As such, charity donations will be made on a regular basis to different organizations with a similar vision.\r\nDoing so can only be made possible by remaining a tight-knit community that is looking to make a difference and sees long-term, by establishing essential and strategic partnerships as well as demonstrating full transparency over our actions."
