        "en": "In the early beginning of 2021, Hamtaro was created. After a few ups and downs, the creator decided they would abandon the contract as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn April of 2021, a holder saw that something was left with Hamtaro. Building a community from a few hundred members to 24k holders, Hamtaro grew at an extraordinary rate! After hitting multiple ATH, the \u2018leader\u2019 had decided to leave. Thus, leading us to now\u2026\r\n\r\nThe issue with a single leader or owner is simple, heavy is the head that wears the crown. If Hamtaro is to become the HUGE community we all dream of, we\u2019ll need everyone to help hold it up! Thus, giving you a say in our future and the birth of \u2018The Hamtaro Committee\u2019. We are a group of Hamtaro holders that have assorted skills in project management, backend development, and marketing. Through the creation of polls, surveys, and AMAs, your wish is our command.\r\n\r\nWe are Hamtaro!"
