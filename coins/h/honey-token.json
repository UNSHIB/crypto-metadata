        "en": "Honey Token is the next generation of video streaming. Our direct competitors are Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple Tv, etc.  What makes our platform different is our approach to content creation.  The Hollywood industry has a top down approach. A few executives decide on what content is created and what shows will continue.  Honey Token believes that fans are taken for granted. After all, fans are the ones that watch and support Hollywood. Our approach is to bring content creators and fans together to collaborate on new content creation.  Furthermore, Honey Token holders get to vote on what cancelled tv shows will be brought back to life and whether the community will finance further episodes.  We created Tokenization, a list of amazing benefits and utility of owning Honey Token."
