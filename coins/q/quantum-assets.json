        "en": "Quantum Assets (QA) uses quantum phenomena to produce a new class of quantum cryptographic keys. Quantum keys are derived from an actual quantum source \u2013 quantum tunnelling of electrons - which are totally unpredictable and entirely random. If something is truly random it follows that it cannot be reverse engineered and is theoretically impossible to breach. This technology is the key to producing cryptographic keys which are theoretically completely secure.\r\n\r\nQuantum keys can be used to produce quantum digital assets. Any digital asset which uses cryptographic keys can benefit from upgrading to using quantum keys. This in turn leads to the creation of a new class of digital assets. Presently, test networks for Quantum Bitcoin and Quantum Ethereum exist with more protocols to follow. A multiverse of quantum assets each denoted by the prefix Quantum is in the works. Users can expect to be able to use Quantum BTC and Quantum ETH in the near future.\r\n\r\nImportantly, holders of Quantum Assets Tokens (QA) at relevant blocks are guaranteed airdrops of new quantum assets as they are released to market."
