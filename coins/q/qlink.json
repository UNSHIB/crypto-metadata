        "en": "QLC Chain is the next generation public Blockchain for decentralized Network-as-a-Service(NaaS). The QLC Chain and supporting ecosystem will enable any individual, business or organization to leverage their network resources to instantly become a service provider or network operator. The mission is to bring people online through a simpler, more pleasant, and more secure way with full transparency.\r\n \r\nIt deploys a multidimensional Block Lattice architecture and uses virtual machines (VM) to manage and support integrated Smart Contract functionality. Additionally, QLC Chain utilizes dual consensus: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Shannon Consensus, which is a novel consensus developed by the QLC Chain team. Through the use of this dual consensus protocol and multidimensional Block Lattice architecture, QLC Chain is able to perform a high number of transactions per second (TPS), provide massive scalability and an inherently decentralized environment for NaaS related decentralized applications (dApp).\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/qlc-chain/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of QLC Chain."
