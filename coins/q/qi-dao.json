Anyone, not only Qi holders, can submit proposals for a Qi vote. Qi tokens have to be staked to form xQi in order to vote. \r\n\r\nQi holders will decide in a consensus how to distribute the Treasury funds to pay for various infrastructure needs and services. The funds in the Treasury are revenues from Closing Fees, and other income streams. The governance mechanism is designed to be flexible and upgradeable over time."
