        "en": "DeSpace Protocol is a new breath of the DeFi industry supporting multi-layer tokens and NFT cards, combining governance, redesigned Yield Farming and NFT Mining features in one protocol. The goal of the project is to create a stable, intuitive and secure system in the DeFi industry for every user, as well as to create value for our NFT cards in our ecosystem. NFTs without any ecosystem can be only used in resale on secondary markets.\r\nDeSpace Protocol creates an ecosystem that values our NFT cards (you can increase your farming income with our NFTs, each NFT has different power, which means that every card will add more interest to your farming). The system works on the principle of layers analogous to layers of a solar system. Each new layer will complement the preceding layer, simultaneously revealing unknown and latent elements in the prior layers, thereby complementing each other. Each layer can be considered as a separate universe and functions independently of the other layers."
