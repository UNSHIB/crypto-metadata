        "en": "Reflection. The system as we know it. HODL and receive riches, they say. You\u2019ll be free, they say. Whales will promise you freedom while dumping their bags on you, making your \u201cpassive income\u201d into \u201cpassive losses\u201d. Want to cash in on your profit? Tough luck, now you need to dump on your fellow HODL\u2019ers, leaving you filled with guilt and them filled with hate.\r\n\r\nUnplug from the system. Embrace True Reflection. The reality of *actual* passive income has come to the Ethereum blockchain. No more dumping on friends. No more fear for whales. With every transaction made, you receive a % in *ETH*. Automatically. No more dumping to collect profit, no more guilt; freedom is yours if you choose for DOGE: Reloaded."
