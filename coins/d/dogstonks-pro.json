        "en": "DogStonks Pro is the next generation of the original DogStonks protocol.\r\n\r\nDogStonks is a token that can be bought at any price, but can only be sold for profit. If you attempt to sell at a cost lower than you bought, the contract won\u2019t allow it.\r\n\r\nAnti-whale mechanics ensure that no single person owns too much of the supply. Only a maximum of 0.5% of the supply can be purchased per transaction.\r\n\r\nThere is a 5 minute cooldown between transactions, which acts as an anti-bot mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo reward loyal holders, the remaining liquidity pool unlocks and distributes to every holder if the price ever fails to make a new all-time high for one full week. It\u2019s a built-in safety net!\r\n\r\nAll liquidity is locked into the contract. Any LP you add will always belong to you and will not be distributed."
