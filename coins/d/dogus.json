DOGUS is also developing a Play 2 Earn Trading Card NFT-based video game. With a daily increasing community. Only 1 billion $DOGUS tokens will ever be minted and 500 million of these were burned at launch. Token burns will be completed on an ongoing basis to provide deflationary gains for the token."
