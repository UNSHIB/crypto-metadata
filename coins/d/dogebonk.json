        "en": "DogeBonk is a token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with deflationary properties and automatic yield generation. 5% tax is applied to all transactions which are distributed to DogeBonk holders just for holding their tokens. Another 5% tax are automatically added to a locked liquidity pool. DOBO had a fair launch: there was no presale and to prevent bots from sniping the token, you can only buy/sell 0.5% of the supply (5,000,000,000,000 tokens) at a time.\r\n\r\nLP tokens are locked forever.\r\nOwnership of contract has been renounced."
