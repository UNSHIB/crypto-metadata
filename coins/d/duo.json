It will also receive token payments at each Reset event.\r\nClass B Token also known as the Leverage Token, entitles leveraged participation of the underlying digital assets.\r\nThe Custodian smart contract performs multiple tasks that facilitate key mechanism of the system, including: creation and redemption of DUO tokens, safekeeping the underlying digital assets (e.g. ETH), calculation of tokens\u2019 net values, and execution of Reset events."
