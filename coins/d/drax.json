        "en": "The purpose of Drax is as a Liquidity Pool wrapper for the Dark Magic token ecosystem. The concept is to give it significantly more flexibility in future use-cases, as well as possible exchange listings/ease of providing liquidity. \r\nPotential secondary use cases include a secondary market for LP\u2019s outside, aggregator listings, self-sustaining ecosystems onboarding, and other gamification elements as we create additional LP wrapper tokens in the ecosystem. To put in in less technical terms: It makes life easier for everyone in managing LP tokens; both for project developers to create value-add and community members. The only way to acquire Drax is to mint it by locking your Dark Magic / axMATIC LP into the Drax smart contract to mint Drax, or buy Drax on a Dex."
