        "en": "The Dogefather EcoSystem, created on 29 April 2021, is a decentralized application ecosystem powered by a DeFi (frictionless yield generation) token built on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThe $DGFTHR token is deflationary, with each transaction having a tax of 2% that is redistributed amongst the holders. The popular redistribution approach incentivizes every investor to HODL and generates tokens in return. The max total supply is 100 quadrillion $DGFTHR, of which 49.7487% was burned to a dead address.\r\n\r\nThe Dogefather EcoSystem is the native utility token that is used inside of our ecosystem that consists of:\r\n\r\n- Decentralized Exchange (DEX)\r\n- NFT Generator Platform\r\n- NFT Marketplace\r\n- Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\r\n- Dogefather Tap & Dogefather Falcon, first of their kind uniquely developed games for a token on Telegram"
