        "en": "Doge Army Token (DGAT) is a unique community token for doge fans. We are built by doge fans, for doge fans, and our goal is to create a community where every doge fan can come together. We will continuously reward our community through weekly giveaway events and redistributions. \r\n\r\nOur mission is: Rewarding Holders, Helping Dogs and Killing Zeros! \r\nWe will fulfill our mission by implementing our unique tokenomics. \r\n\r\nFirst of all the redistribution, from each transaction 2% will automatically redistribute to holders. \r\nSecondly the giveaways, within each transaction there is a 2% tax that will be sent to a specific wallet. Each week we will hold a giveaway to holders that meet the requirements. There will be a total of 5 people that will win. Lastly the Doge Army Foundation, there is a 1% tax within each transaction that will be send to the giveaway wallet.\r\nFrom this wallet we will donate every month to a charity chosen by our community. Of course, all of this will be done live and with proof.\r\n\r\nThis token is made to build a community and give back to it."
