        "en": "Daddy Shark Token introduces customizable rewards, unique Shark NFTs, a NFT marketplace, NFT games, and SharkInvest into the charitable Baby Shark ecosystem focused on ocean conservation.  \r\n\r\nThe Baby Shark Token team is behind Daddy Shark Token.  The team launched Baby Shark Token back in May of 2021 with a main mission of ocean conservation.  We aligned ourselves with several ocean conservation charity partners, and now the developers are looking to introduce new use-cases to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nDaddy Shark offers NFTs and games to all holders.  Holders will be able to mint fully unique Shark NFTs out of 10,000 total, trade NFTs on the custom NFT marketplace, play Mini-Games with Shark NFTs, and battle NFTs in the upcoming play-to-earn game.  Daddy Shark also offers customizable rewards and SharkInvest.  Holders can customize rewards to be any BSC token on the rewards dashboard, track their rewards on the new dashboard, invest with the new SharkInvest Hedge Fund, and discover new tokens with the Opportunity Fund."
