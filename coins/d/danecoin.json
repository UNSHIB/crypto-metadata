        "en": "Danecoin is a revolutionary peer-to-peer electronic cash system that allows you to send money over the internet, without any restrictions. Danecoin is fully decentralized, open source, and gives users full control over their money. Designed for any transaction, Danecoin is fast, efficient and secure, backed by industry leading technology and security. Danecoin will not only be available to use on our proprietary use-case platforms, but you will be able to use Danecoin for your everyday purchases and transactions as well.\r\n\r\nAt Danecoin, we have a global vision. Our plans are for Danecoin to be used worldwide, especially in countries and regions who are struck by poverty and don't have access to using and investing in crpytocurrency. We are establishing partnerships in these countries and regions to start making this a reality, one step at a time. We hope to start making a true difference in these communities starting Q1 of 2022.\r\n\r\nDanecoin currently has 5 proprietary use case platforms in development. The first platform will launch to the public in January, 2022. The remaining 4 platforms  will also launch in 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also have 36 approved Crypto Exchange contract listings, which we are working on finalizing as I write this"
