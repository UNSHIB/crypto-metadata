        "en": "\"DogeZero is a DOGE rewards token that has a 0% Buy Tax and a 16% sales tax with the taxes broken down based on the tokenomics shown on our website. Anyone holding DogeZero gets rewards in $DOGE which is driven by sales volume. The built-in buyback and burn mechanism makes DogeZero hyper-deflationary and increases the value of the token with each buyback.\r\n\r\nDogeZero will shortly launch a custom NFT collection and will be building in a Lottery system for community members to play. Future roadmap items includes a card payment gateway, farming and staking, a merchandise store and central exchange listings.\""
