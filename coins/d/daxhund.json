        "en": "Decentralised financial products launched on Ethereum brought new spaces for potentially fraudulent actions. That includes liquidity pools locking, PnDs (pump and dump), hard and soft rug-pulls, and many other. As many new DeFi projects suffered from various bad outcomes, which often resulted in obtaining investor funds, other legitimate ideas need to deal with FUD (fear, uncertainty disbelief), rather than focus on further project development.\r\n\r\nDAXHUND project is introduced to address these difficulties. Our dAPP will revolutionize the due-diligence process for early investors, keeping them away from cryptoscams."
