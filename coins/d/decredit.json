        "en": "DeCredit is a DeFi 2.0 protocol that empowers the DeFi market by introducing the credit loan models. \r\nIt links credit authentication nodes and credit Oracle to lending products on the premise of existing encrypted collateralised loan models, with a view to progressively reduce and finally eliminate collaterals, enabling staggered resource allocation and enabling the blockchain paradigm to inclusively empower the traditional financial lending sector. \r\nBy doing this, DeCredit leverages the tremendous momentum generated by DeFi to provide liquidity support to a wider range of entities and individuals."
