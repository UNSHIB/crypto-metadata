        "en": "Chainbinders - the ultimate NFT holding game backed by a reserve pool of 2672 ETH.\r\nBND is the only token that can be used to play the Chainbinders Gacha machine and obtain the NFTs. 100% of BND spent will be burned and 50% of the NFTs have redeemable value in ETH. The supply of BND will be zero once there are no more NFTs left in the machine. Players can choose to burn their NFT in exchange for ETH from a reserve pool, in a process called unbinding. Rare NFTs can be redeemed for more. Game theory: as others burn their NFTs, the redeemable value of your own increases.\r\nChainbinders is a product of Doki Doki, the NFT Gacha platform."
