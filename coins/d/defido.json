More specifically, it is a hyper-deflationary subcoin with a smart sharing system built into the ecosystem, so each investor gets more DeFido added to their wallet. For every transfer, buy/sell has 8% commission fee, 4% will be distributed to holders and the other 4% will be added for project development."
