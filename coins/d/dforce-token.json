Instant withdrawal supported. \u2022 USDx (https://usdx.dforce.network/), the first decentralized and fiat-back stablecoin implementing systematic interest. 1 USDx = 80% USDC +10% PAX + 10% TUSD. USDx holders can earn interest by simply depositing USDx into the USR contract and can withdraw at any time.\r\n\u2022 GOLDx (https://goldx.dforce.network/), a gold token 100% backed by physical gold (through constituent gold token PAXG) and is denominated in gram.
