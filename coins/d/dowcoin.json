This record contains each exchange at any point handled enabling a client's PC to confirm the legitimacy of every exchange. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending Dowcoins from their own Dowcoin addresses. It is also important to note that Dowcoin was developed on the Ethereum blockchain and as such, the token will be independent and can run without third-party interference."
