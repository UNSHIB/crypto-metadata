        "en": "The Dark Matter ecosystem enables people to create interlinked projects while allowing each project to regain full autonomy and independence. The separate projects on the Dark Matter network don\u2019t have to rely on each other, but if they make profit, the revenue is distributed to all Dark Matter Token liquidity providers. It\u2019s a simple way to incentivize creativity and exploring new possibilities of blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nA large number of the projects created in the Dark Matter ecosystem explore the idea of Non-Fungible Tokens. NFTs are currently one of the few popular solutions which successfully combine blockchain technology with the creative freedom of art."
