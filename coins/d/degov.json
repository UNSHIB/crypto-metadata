        "en": "DEGOV is the fully-decentralized fairly-distributed governance token of the DEBASE protocol. The DEBASE protocol is highly parameterized making on-chain governance powerful. Threshold quorum is 20% of the maximum supply (25,000 tokens fixed supply). Additionally, DEGOV holders with more than 250 DEGOV are permitted to submit proposals for voting. DEGOV holders earn DAI rewards from the DEBASE Treasury under certain conditions of the DEBASE economy."
