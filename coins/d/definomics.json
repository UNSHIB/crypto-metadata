        "en": "DeFinomics is a decentralized Platform and a working product. Currently Staking and Mobile Staking is available on our newly upgraded APP section. Staking is set at 128% APY and fees are burnt monthly to help with deflation.  You can connect your wallet to our APP section which includes live pricing with links to charts, current value converted into dollars, and a Trade section where you can buy or sell. We have also included an Announcements section so you can keep updated with the Project.  The APP also includes a full BSC Exchange feature where you can swap other currencies right on the Platform.  FINEXBOX is our first Centralized exchange and plan on more.  We have plans to be a one stop APP with possible Farming, NFT Marketplace, and LaunchPad goals."
