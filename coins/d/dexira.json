        "en": "dexIRA provides fully automated multi-currency dividend rewards, advanced buyback protocols and tokenomics that promote long term holding and wealth generation. \r\n\r\nThe platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts). Borrowing from the long-term investment idea behind a traditional IRA, dexIRA investors can grow their holdings commission-free similar to tax-free IRA contributions. This allows members to increase their stake in the reward pool over time without sacrificing initial capital. \r\n\r\nAfter a one-year holding period, investors can sell their DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, similar to the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they're penalized."
