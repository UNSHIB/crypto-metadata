Buybacks: Delta Exchange will use a part of the fee earned on the exchange to buyback DETO.\r\n5. Staking and Exchange Utility: Staking with fair lock-up periods. Use DETO to pay fees, use as margin, etc.\r\n\r\nDelta Exchange is a robust crypto derivatives exchange, offering Futures and Options on Bitcoin and 60+ Altcoins.
