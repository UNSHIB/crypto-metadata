Collect quality players, equip the strongest items to have the strongest Heroes on the pitch\r\n\r\nWhy Blockchain?\r\nThe Soccer Infinity team is made up of seasoned blockchain experts that have been involved in, or are currently developing, some of the industry's earliest infrastructure. With DeFi having been shown as one of the first genuine use cases of blockchain technology, we believe that gaming is the next big revolution.\r\nBy having important elements of the game stored on-chain, blockchain and especially NFT-based gaming will relieve some of the issues currently present in traditional gaming such as provable ownership and trust less item transfers.\r\nWithin the next few years, blockchain gaming will undoubtedly disrupt and earn its place in the overall gaming market, most notably the mobile phone gaming sector. We envision and hope to be able to provide these opportunities through our game, whilst also introducing new people to crypto in a fun and exciting way, starting with the sport that the world knows and loves \u2014 Football."
