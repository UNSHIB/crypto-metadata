        "en": "SWYFT is a Proof of Stake and Masternode Cryptocurrency project that is comprised of an ecosystem of different platforms. Unlike other crypto projects, these platforms are already launched and active, providing income to the project and maintaining the value of the SWYFT blockchain. There are currently three platforms and use cases for the SWYFT coin, with more planned for the future. Please note that the SWYFT project is not a new ICO. The project is a merge between the previous BiFrost (FROST) and SWYFT (SATC) projects and builds upon the XSN blockchain (DASH-based). Unlike many other projects that one can find in the marketplace, we believe in delivering real projects and use cases, with more in store for the future. Our existing platforms include SWYFT Play, SWYFT Host, and SWYFT Trust with Shade My Trade planned for future development."
