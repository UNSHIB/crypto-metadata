With the highest attention to the details of production, from planting rice seeds to hand-bottling to order, SAK\u039e is curated by Sake Samurai Elliot Faber and produced by Kitanishi Shuzo, makers of Bunraku, with a bottle designed by BIG Architects and featuring the art of Jonathan Jay Lee.\r\n\r\nOnly 888 bottles of SAK\u039e will ever be made."
