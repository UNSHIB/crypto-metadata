Our goal is to be a liaison between charities and crypto currency\u2019s, enabling people to easily and smoothly donate to charity with whatever crypto currency they may own. Currently very few charities are able to accept crypto, at Saint, our goal is to bridge the gap between the two making it easy for both charities and crypto holders to accept and give donations."
