The ratio is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022 5% is proportionally distributed to all holders, no farming needed. The amount of tokens in your wallet will grow with every transaction, making it a forever-deflationary token.\r\n\u2022 5% is added to the Liquidity pool, which increases the price stability over time, and makes the price floor higher, thus enhancing the token\u2019s usability and protecting your investment."
