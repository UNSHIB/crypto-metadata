        "en": "Spinada.cash is a completely decentralized protocol for private transactions on Cardano blockchain. It breaks the on-chain link between senders and receivers of Cardano native tokens on the blockchain. This gives complete privacy and security in a completely decentralized manner.\r\n\r\nIt uses a Zero Knowledge proof protocol known as zk-SNARKs , developed by the good fellows at Zcash, to ensure secure anonymous transactions of Cardano assets on the blockchain. It uses a Smart contract which accepts Cardano tokens and then allows anyone with a proof of knowledge to withdraw those tokens through the use of Cryptographic key notes. When a sender submits a transaction, he receives a Key Note and a corresponding hash is received by the Smart contract. When a receiver furnishes the right Key note, it is matched with the hash to output the corresponding submitted tokens."
