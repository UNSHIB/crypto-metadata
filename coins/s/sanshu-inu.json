We are constantly growing and making new memes to create a fun and friendly environment in our telegram. Soon, given enough support for SANSHU, we will allow holders of SANSHU/ETH LP tokens to farm new types of dogs and/or utility tokens. This is what we think will make us stand out from the rest of the ETH dogs."
