        "en": "SafeVault is a compounding interest token which rewards in BUSD. We have a buy fee of 2% and a sell fee of 30%. A large percent (74.35%) of all fees go towards the holders as rewards in BUSD. This happens every 12+ hours and is automatic.\r\n\r\nWe have a buyback and burn feature that is constantly buying and burning SafeVault making it a hyper-deflationary asset.\r\n\r\nWe are the same Dev Team as ETHVault and plan on building an entire system of compounding digital assets."
