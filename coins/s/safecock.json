        "en": "SafeCock is a community driven project using several of the powerful tokenomic advances seen in many modern tokens. These include an auto-staking function that redistributes 2% of each transaction to existing tokenholders. In addition, 2% of each transaction is added to the liquidity pool, and 4% is burned.\r\n\r\nThe team and the community behind the project have a bold and positive vision that will prove both the power of memes and the power of advanced smart contract tokenomics in a single project. The meme component celebrates the noble rooster, just as many other animal-themed tokens do.\r\n\r\nPlans to launch an NFT platform and a DAO platform are already under way."
