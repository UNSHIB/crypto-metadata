There are no VC or private investor allocations and no team tokens! Only the CardStarter community will have the opportunity to contribute to SHUFFLE!\u2019s entire raise, acting as community seed.\r\n\r\nWhat is SHUFFLE!?\r\nSHUFFLE! is a deflationary jackpot game with 100% of the proceeds providing value to the SHUFFLE! community. Players can win in a variety of ways. \r\n\r\nPrizes include more $SHFL tokens, as well as additional jackpots containing $CARDS, $GERO, $C3, and other CardStarter IDO tokens. A percentage of house proceeds are permanently burned in the \r\n\r\nSHUFFLE! Token Furnace while the remainder will replenish the winnings, build the jackpots, and keep the ecosystem operational. $SHFL will be attractive to speculators due to the deflation mechanism, as well as anyone who wants to utilize the platform!"
