The vision is to offer a very simple interface for users to convert their crypto assets on-chain and in a decentralized way. In addition, developers can raise funds via SuperSale and add liquidity for their investors via SuperDEX. $SSN can be used for governance, and can be staked to earn a portion of the fees charged via SuperSale and many other use cases"
