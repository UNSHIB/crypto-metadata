        "en": "Sphere was built on the idea that privacy, company transparency, and data security should be the fundamental building blocks of every social platform. So we believe that the millions those corporations are making off of your data doesn\u2019t belong to them, it belongs to you.\r\n\r\nSphere is so much more than another simple addition into the growing line of social media networks available. It is the beginning of a digital revolution.\r\n\r\nSphere is a Decentralized Social Network platform that offers an integrated, decentralized market, complete with its own advertising platform. Unlike other social media juggernauts that sell your online privacy to the highest bidder. Sphere empowers its users to take back profits these companies make from selling your data. We introduce the Social Activity Token, SAT a cryptocurrency used to facilitate transactions within the Sphere Network. Users will enjoy the benefits of privacy and security. If companies want your data, they will have to compensate you.\r\n\r\nAptly named Social Activity Tokens, or SATs for short: this brand new form of cryptocurrency can be used for a wide variety of uses and can even be utilized to fund grass roots campaigns and movements, allowing them to reach more people and larger audiences. To celebrate the launch and welcome the coming digital revolution, Sphere is holding an open offering to all those ready to join something special and different. This special occasion, only available now, will set the precedent for the entire value of the SATs. And once it\u2019s over, no more SAT tokens will ever be produced."
