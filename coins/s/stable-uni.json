        "en": "$oneUNI was created on 08/23/2021 with the ICHI Factory, audited by Quantstamp and Solidified. It will become a new base asset on Uniswap. \r\n$oneUNI can be recommended to $UNI grant recipients who need USD exposure. For example, grants could be paid in $oneUNI, enabling grant recipients like the DeFi Alliance to pay for necessary operational expenses. You can deposit $oneUNI to earn $ICHI rewards on ichi.org."
