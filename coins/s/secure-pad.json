        "en": "Secure Pad aims to be the go-to launchpad for new projects, pairing Founders with other skilled industry participants in the crypto space. Founders can fill the missing roles that will take their vision from idea to finished product. Secure Pad will be a network connecting Founders to developers, auditors, designers, marketers, advisors, or any other role a project may need to complete their team, and on the path to success. A one-stop shop that helps projects plan, hold pre-sale fundraises, lock liquidity, and launch securely.\r\n\r\nHolders of the $SEPA token will have the ability to receive staking rewards in tokens of projects launched through the Secure Pad launchpad. The $SEPA token has deflationary properties as outlined in the Whitepaper. Further, through the Reserve & Repay fund, investors can set up a claim in the unlikely event a project launched on the Secure Pad platform has an exploit from an outside attacker or rogue team member. *Claims are limited to a percentage of the Reserve & Repay fund, at time of incident."
