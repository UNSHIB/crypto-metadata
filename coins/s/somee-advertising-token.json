        "en": "SoMee.Social is a new social media platform that prioritizes user privacy and autonomy. Strong incentives are built in to encourage user interactions and quality content with the goal of cultivating a cohesive community building. SoMee.Social provides several avenues for earning rewards, starting with content monetization, and reward earning options for active participation in the community or for sharing your data if you choose to do so. SoMee.Social is a blockchain based platform governed by the existing $SOMEE token and an advertising system powered by the $SAT token.\r\n\r\n$SAT is the only token used for advertisers to pay for their campaign. Also, influencers will need $SAT to participate in the $SAT Elite campaigns that offer higher monetization amounts and special perks. This will drive significant utility for $SAT and create more demand for \u201cstacking SATs\u201d as the platform expands advertising and increases the amount of influencers participating in these campaigns."
