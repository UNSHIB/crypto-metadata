        "en": "During ancient times, wood, timber and waste products were the only major energy sources. In short, biomass was the only way to get energy. When more technology was developed, fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas were discovered. Fossil fuels proved a boon to mankind as they were widely available and could be harnessed easily.\r\n\r\nWhen these fossil fuels were started using extensively by all the countries across the globe, they led to the degradation of the environment. Coal and oil are two of the major sources that produce a large amount of carbon dioxide in the air. This led to an increase in global warming.\r\n\r\nAlso, few countries have held on these valuable products, which led to the rise in the prices of these fuels. Now, with rising prices, increasing air pollution and the risk of getting expired soon forced scientists to look out for some alternative or renewable energy sources.\r\n\r\nWe turned a tweet into a real use case! The need of the hour is to look for resources that are available widely, cause no pollution and are replenishable. Sustainable Energy comes into the picture to meet today\u2019s increasing demand for energy."
