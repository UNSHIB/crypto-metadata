We believe that a decentralized, blockchain-based platform will be better and a more future-proof replacement for such platforms. Because Stipend\u2019s platform relies on the blockchain \u2013 all transactions, ratings and history will be permanently engraved into the blockchain which will further increase the openness and transparency in this market."
