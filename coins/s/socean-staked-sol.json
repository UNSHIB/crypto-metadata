        "en": "Socean is a noncustodial stake pool for the Solana blockchain based on the Solana stake pool reference implementation. Users deposit SOL, we stake it for them, and give them a derivative token called SOCN that can be redeemed for SOL at any time. The SOCN token can then be used in several different use-cases, like lending/borrowing, liquidity provision, trading, etc."
