        "en": "SBD rewards its holders each weeks by paying them 2.25% of the total amount of transactions. They also redistribute 1% of all transactions, to the holders which allows them to accumulate over time.\r\nThe main purpose of SBD is to be a platform that gives financial opportunities to small holders. The project states, that they provide to their community an Anti-Whale feature that ensures any transaction superior to 0.05% of the total supply is rejected, which is an effective strategy to avoid the pump-dump exit whales from sabotaging the project."
