        "en": "SUGAR Token is redesigning the way Defi is operating. SUGAR Token is focused on raising awareness and evolving how new BSC works while delivering a robust system ever designed for safer investments based on Sugarland Safepaper.\r\n\r\nSUGAR Token is a reflection token built on Smart Chain and later developed for cross chain.\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind SUGAR Token is to provide a ecosystem of audit & consultancy services, build user friendly dApps, games, NFTs. The path forward for SUGAR Token is determined by market fluctuations, but the mission it runs on, will make SUGAR Token succeed.\r\n\r\nSUGAR Token has a maximum circulation supply of 45Trillion on all chains combined. Depending on each holder's percentage of ownership, a 4% transaction tax is distributed among all holders, including the burn address, which also will start collecting token reflections and gradually will make the supply go down, leading to scarcity of the token. Since there is no burn limit, holders get a never ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure."
