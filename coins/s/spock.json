        "en": "Spock Network is a decentralized storage application platform. In the early stage, Spock Network mainly stores Proof of Capacity (POC) consensus data to effectively utilize the most suitable decentralization technology to encourage miners providing hard disk space. At the same time, on this basis, the support of smart contracts has also been added to support decentralized applications and POC-type tokens. In the future, the data stored in the Spock Network can be documents in any format such as documents, videos, and images, and truly fulfill the ideal of making block chain technology beneficial to everyone.\r\n\r\nSpock is the leading charactor in the American classic sci-fi series Star Trek. This character represents rationality, justice, and the courage to explore the unknown. We chose Spock as the project name to encourage the team to keep exploration of the new possibilities of the blockchain."
