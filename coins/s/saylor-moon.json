        "en": "SaylorMoon is a community driven meme token on Binance Smart Chain. The token is based on Elon Musk\u2019s tweet.\r\n\r\nThe fight between Saylor and Musk is a fight where only one will be victorious! \r\n\r\nThis project is developed by a team based in Europe. The community takes a huge role, as holders can involve as much as they want with the project. All the decisions are voted between the members.\r\n\r\nThe devs of this project don\u2019t hold large wallets (~1%) and the liquidity is locked until 2100, so there shouldn\u2019t be fear for things like a rugpull. Also, the dev team has made public their faces and real names in the Telegram groups so anyone can check their profiles online.\r\n\r\nThis project is based on a healthy, growing community. All the decisions are based on the consensus between developers and holders.\r\nEach transaction has a 10% fee, which is split in two different ways:\r\n5% fee is auto redistributed to all existing holders.\r\n5% fee is added to the liquidity pool and used for other token growing purposes (like marketing).\r\nThere are intentions to contribute to charity as the project grows.\r\nThis is the first lady token standard, and we want to make a big ladies community in the crypto world."
