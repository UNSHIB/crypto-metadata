        "en": "SeaDog Finance is the first MEME Token based on TRON, a decentralized token created by a group of users who love the earth and cryptocurrency. SeaDog Token will 100% put in JustSwap and destroy the private key in order to achieve completely decentralization. SeaDog is a deflationary token. Each time of transaction will burn 5% of the tokens. 2% of tokens will be thrown into the black hole for permanent destruction in order to increase its value. 2% will go to token holders for reward, and 1% will be distributed to the SeaDog Foundation to sponsor the Global Marine Conservation Institute. Every Sea Dog holder will use SeaDog to trade, let the entire cryptocurrency ecology closer to our world."
