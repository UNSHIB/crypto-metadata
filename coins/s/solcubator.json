        "en": "Solcubator aims to drive the expansion and adoption of the Solana ecosystem by providing a secure and decentralized platform for projects seeking funding and incubation and for investors to filter the value-added projects as it's community-driven. Over time, the platform will evolve into a full-fledged DeFi-based solution protocol by introducing various products, such as a farm, a DEX, and lending & borrowing facilities. You can expect at least one product to be added to the ecosystem per quarter, and for every product, the SOLC token will play a central role."
