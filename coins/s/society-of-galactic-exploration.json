        "en": "SGE is a foundational ERC-20 coin that supports and celebrates space exploration. The development and marketing wallet will allow the SGE team to produce a mobile application that permits users to control remote telescopes and explore space like never before. SGE is also partnered with observatories that will produce custom NFT\u2019s from beautiful images of the night sky. \r\n\r\nOur NFT platform will have smart contracts that auto-inject liquidity into the SGE/ETH pair. In total, 5% of the Ethereum from the sales will be injected as liquidity, while the other 5% goes towards the development funds"
