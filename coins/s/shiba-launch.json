        "en": "Shiba Launch is the new alternative coin towards $Shib after the unpredictable actions of the co-creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, dumping a majority of his coins. With approx ~50% of the total supply sent to Vitalik Buterin, this action could be repeated at any time, basically making $Shib a very dangerous buy. With $ShibM, 50% of the total supply will rather be sent to a burn address, and instead secure the growth and moon of the coin $Shib."
