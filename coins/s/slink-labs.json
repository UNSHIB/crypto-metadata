        "en": "SLINK LABS is a token incubator company for Shiba Link, where developers and individuals can apply and receive help on their token or marketing, funding, and development. The SLINK idea was founded by a team of like-minded individuals who saw a vision in creating tokens in various blockchains. SLINK is governed by the main team of developers, and it\u2019s scheduled to offer a variety of projects.\r\n\r\nSLINK is a token similar to owning stock of a company. Their tokens present SLINK LABS regardless of your network, whether ERC, BSC, or MATIC. In addition, the buyback mechanism serves as a dividend to all holders of the token. SLINK is unique from the rest of the tokens in that its price is not fully dependent or limited to community pricing action. Instead, it generates its revenue across all tokens under SLINK LABS."
