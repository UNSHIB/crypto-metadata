        "en": "Stakenet is a Lightning Network-ready open-source platform for decentralized applications (dApps) with its native cryptocurrency \u2013 XSN. It is the first blockchain with Masternodes to be Lightning Network ready. XSN has instant, virtually feeless, and unlimited transactions per second, and has the first Lightning Network DEX running on its network. XSN is the first, next to Bitcoin and Litecoin, to ever perform Lightning Swaps.\r\n\r\nXSN is digital money, like bitcoin in the Bitcoin blockchain, or ether in Ethereum, as its supply is not controlled by any government or company. With Stakenet\u2019s Trustless Proof of Stake, users can stake their coins from cold storage (such as a hardware wallet) and receive staking rewards whilst their funds are offline and not at risk - with the goal of offering strong security"
