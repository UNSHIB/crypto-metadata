        "en": "SMUGDOGE is a token on Harmony with deflationary properties and automatic yield generation for the holders. 5% tax is applied to all transactions which are distributed to fellow Smuggies just for holding their tokens. Another 5% tax are automatically added to a locked liquidity pool to generate an ever rising price floor! The tax applied is meant to incentivize long term holding and the anti-whale mechanics implemented on launch made sure that the coin could not be sniped."
