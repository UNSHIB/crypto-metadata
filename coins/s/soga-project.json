        "en": "SOGA is a blockchain-based social sharing platform. With a more and more centralized social network trend, nowadays, we hope to create a new social experience with stronger self-value and more interest for users. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, SOGA is committed to creating a decentralized, secure, efficient, and valuable blockchain social sharing platform which enables us to communicate without worrying about the leakage and the malicious use of our chat content. Thanks to the untamperable and traceable features of blockchain, protecting rights and interests becomes easy and effective, so we can publish original content as we like and enjoy the benefits it brings to us without concerns on having our legitimate rights and interests infringed."
