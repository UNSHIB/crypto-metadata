        "en": "A revolutionary approach in the Crypto Industry. A first of its kind Exchange Solution, building new foundations in Crypto Security. Made in Canada, by Canadians, to deliver to the World!\r\n\r\nSteam Exchange is a Centralized Exchange based in Ontario, Canada.\r\n\r\nSteamX Token will serve two purposes:\r\n1) Provide initial holders to Steam Exchange when launched\r\n2) Make the market for Steam Exchange when launched\r\n\r\nSteam Exchange is a revolution. Canada has had the short end of the stick when it comes to Centralized Exchanges and regulations. With major CEX exiting key provinces in Ontario, Canada is left with few options, and quite frankly, those options do not offer the solution Canada deserves. Steam Exchange strives to do what the best exchanges do, and do it better!\r\n\r\nStarting with Canada, walk into any Steam Exchange location to open and manage your Steam Exchange account. Steam Exchange will offer best in class courses and training for new investors in the Crypto Space!\r\n\r\nThis project is not optional for Canada... it is mandatory! Canada deserves greatness, and Steam Exchange aims to deliver!"
