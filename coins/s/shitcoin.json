We will ask them nicely with a very well written letter.\r\n\r\nTo advance the crypto world by having a larger token supply. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Ethereum has 100 million. ShitCoin has 1 trillion. Which makes it beter.\r\n\r\nTo generate wealth for the dev team, whales, and a lucky few. Maybe you!"
