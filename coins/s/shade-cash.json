        "en": "A decentralized protocol for private transactions on the Fantom Opera\r\n\r\nShade Cash improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between the sender and receivers address. It uses smart contracts that only accepts a fixed amount of FTM to be deposited that can then be withdrawn by a different address. To preserve privacy a relayer can be used to withdraw to an address with no FTM balance. There is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring absolute privacy."
