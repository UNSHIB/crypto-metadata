        "en": "Secret Finance (SEFI) is the governance token for SecretSwap and the Secret Network DeFi ecosystem. Users of SecretSwap can earn SEFI to participate in shaping the future of Secret Network's front-running resistant, privacy-first open financial system. \r\n\r\nSecretSwap is a protocol for creating liquidity and trading SNIP-20 tokens on Secret Network. Leveraging privacy-preserving \"\"secret\"\" smart contracts, SecretSwap protects users against malicious front-running and privacy threats, provides access to cross-chain liquidity, and reduces fees relative to Ethereum.\r\n\r\nSEFI is an application layer governance token specifically for Secret Swap parameters, developer fund spending, and application related changes. This is in contrast to SCRT, which is the native governance token of the Secret Network protocol layer."
