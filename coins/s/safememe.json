        "en": "SafeMeme is an ecosystem of tools for investors and teams. \r\nThe project is building an exchange and launchpad for community and meme projects. Candidate projects will have to pass SAFEMEME's safety protocol. Tis protocol includes contract auditing, pre-sale & launch support measures (whitelisting, anti-bot measures, whale prevention strategy etc.), fundamentals review and support etc.\r\nThis ecosystem will allow projects that do not have the resources to access mainstream audits and tier 1 launchpads, the possibility of launching on a platform with a legitimate covenant and strong credibility with investors.\r\nBy providing its own safety protocol, SAFEMEME aims to become a reliable platform for new investors that will not have to worry about the potential scams and rug-pulls that plague the crypto space."
