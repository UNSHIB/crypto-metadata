        "en": "Smart MFG (MFG) is an ERC20 cryptocurrency token issued by Smart MFG Tech for use in supply chain and manufacturing smart contracts. MFG can be used to incentivize RFQs, secure and pay for smart contract POs (Purchase Orders) along with supply chain tokenization on the manufacturing blockchain.\r\n\r\nSmart MFG claims to be 'the pioneer and creator of the smart manufacturing blockchain process architecture protocol' (patent pending). SyncFab is also a digital manufacturing platform that enables hardware supply chain buyers to transact POs (purchase orders) and source RFQs (requests for quotes) directly from a network of manufacturers (launched in 2013)."
