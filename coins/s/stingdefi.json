        "en": "StingDefi is a gaming platform that allows creators to craft, play, distribute, and trade without the need for centralized power, thus maintaining stable copyright ownership and earning further StingDefi (SDFI). The Binance Smart chain technology, SDFI the platform's utility token, is used to create, own, and monetize the StingDefi, a virtual environment where players can design, own, and monetize their gaming experiences. Our goal is to provide a fully interactive metaverse in which players collaborate to build simulated environments and games without the need for centralized control. StingDefi aims to disrupt current game makers such as Minecraft and Roblox by giving creators true ownership of their creations in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and rewarding their participation with our utility token, SDFI."
