        "en": "Samoyedcoin ($SAMO) is Solana\u2019s memecoin, aiming to be community-owned and fun. \r\n\r\nIt was inspired by Dogecoin, Sam Bankman-Fried (CEO of Alameda Research and FTX) and Anatoly Yakovenko (co-founder of Solana), hence the choice of the dog breed samoyed, bringing these two giants together. \r\n\r\nIt aims to help grow Solana's ecosystem by appealing beyond its core, mostly composed of highly technological coins. \r\n\r\nThe community is already strong with SAMO only being a few days old, and growing larger by appealing to people who would not be interested in cryptocurrencies. It has all the upsides of Solana's blockchain (high scalability, high speed, low fees) while being a fun cryptocurrency to trade."
