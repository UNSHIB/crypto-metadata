        "en": "Summit DeFi is a liquidity farm which ads a gamified element to Yield - such that you can risk that yield to multiply it in a luck based game represented by totems.  For example - at the Oasis tier there are two totems, meaning  you have a 50/50 chance of winning against those who have backed the other totem.\r\n\r\nThe money deposited into Summit Finance is pass-through staked into farms to build yield which is returned to users in an \"\"Expedition\"\" at the end of every week (also in a risk based game).    The value we add is these two elements - adding a bit of fun to the regular farm and providing yield back through the pass through mechanism. .  "
