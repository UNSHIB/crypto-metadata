        "en": "Sharpay is a unique technological and very simple share button. Sites put the button under any content instead of other old sharing buttons and users get rewards for sharing. The system has fraud protection, bot defense with audience targeting possibility based on CPV (cost per visit) payments. Sharpay is the share and multi-share button for sites with blockchain-based rewards for content promotion for users. Multisharing is an opportunity to share the content in several networks in one click. Users receive rewards for the act of sharing or for the visits of other users via the shared links (depends on site settings). All that means the conversion growth for sites and comfortable sharing for users.\r\n\r\nThe sharpay button can look like anything, for example, it can be designed like on this page or customized for the any webdesign you wish. The sharpay button can be any color and shape, it can have any logos of connected social networks. The main feature of the button is the code, which is activated when you click on the button. Also, we can use your own design and match it with our code."
