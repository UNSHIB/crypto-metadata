        "en": "The SHUSKY platform is an open source, community-driven project with solid tokenomics, fully based on Ethereum blockchain using ERC20 smart contract. The decentralised consensus mechanism enables a wide range of participants to contribute to the development. The community has the greatest influence on the direction of the SHUSKY project and helps to expand it through their own initiatives and involvement, enhancing the value of the platform via collaborations.\r\n\r\nAt it\u2019s heart, SHUSKY is a deflationary, community-driven project which holds real-world application. Currently all SHUSKY holders earn 1% of total transactions generated and there are plans to implement further DeFi applications in the coming months (i.e staking). In essence, these reward mechanisms act to increase overall growth and demand for the project while also incentivise the long term holding of tokens."
