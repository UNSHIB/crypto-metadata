        "en": "Strite aims to close the gap between the general public and cryptocurrency. It's goal is to create a public marketplace where individuals may buy and sell specifically featured NFTs in a user-friendly manner. The first step in executing this plan is to use the already established social media presence to reach out to large influencers and help them create content to publish as their very first custom NFTs. These NFTs will be sold in our marketplace and thus attracting their audiences.\r\n\r\nThis will then help Strite move towards it's goal of creating a safe and friendly environment for investors, influencers, and ultimately the average person. With influencer marketing becoming a leading force in the digital marketing realm, Strite expects to take full advantage of this."
