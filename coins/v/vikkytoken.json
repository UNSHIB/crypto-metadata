        "en": "Vikky is a platform where you could earn money by completing various tasks. Vikky uses VIKKY Token as our unit of payment, based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform.\r\n\r\nThe investors can use Vikky\u2019s service to look for short-term, flexible and suitable staffs for their needs. VIKKY token is usable worldwide \u2013 Use it to pay, exchange on Crypto trading sites, or exchange into your preferred fiat currency.\r\n\r\nVIKKY token is going to be issued with a limited amount, therefore, once VIKKY token spread globally, its value will multiply rapidly, producing a large profit for investors.\r\n\r\nVikky is an application that allows you to advertise short term jobs, displaying locations on the map from chores such as electricity and water repairs, houses, gardening, etc. to deliver goods from one place to another.\r\nVikky draws on a route map that connects the departure and destination (such as the itinerary), allowing the recipient to easily find a task suitable to their flight. Or a carrier could get more goods on the way to their destination.\r\nVikky also allows users to filter by industry category of interest, or by language of use. Just change the language, for example to Chinese, the Chinese community in the world will see each other regardless of geographic location. This also helps communities to be separated, and not messing up together. Users only need to choose the work nearby which suits themselves, apply for it and wait for the response of the employers. When both sides have agreed, the work will be carried out. Workers receive their earnings when work is completed.\r\n\r\nWorker or outsourcer information is valued by the community, which enhances the reputation of the employer and the poster, contributing to the reduction of false or fraudulent information. However, only individuals who have traded through Vikky can judge the others, this is the way to avoid phony assessment. Participants in Vikky are very diverse: from ordinary housewives, students, students, engineers, mechanics, to companies that need to recruit short-term workers, and even those who travel, long-distance truck drivers, and even Uber, Grab drivers. Airbnb's owners can also hire a cleaner with Vikky. Or guests of Airbnb can also rent bicycles, find guides, etc. through Vikky."
