        "en": "\"Viralata Finance ($REAU) is a decentralized, open source project introducing Brazilians to the world of cryptocurrency by providing a safe and easy-to-use set of apps, with a charitable twist.\r\n\r\nIts goals are to encourage and empower Brazilians to take their finances into their own hands; demonstrate the potential of alternative financial solutions; provide services to markets that are largely overlooked and under served in Brazil such as micro and small capital businesses, freelancers; and extend a helping hand to the stray dog population that served as inspiration for this project.\r\n\r\nSince its creation on March 21, 2021, the Vira-lata Finance community has already helped several non-governmental organizations and persons that provide animal welfare and take care of abandoned animals, by donating more than $10,000 to these NGOs.\r\n"
