        "en": "The VOLENTIX Digital Assets Ecosystem (DAE) began as an array of individuals each of whom had experienced the frustration and dismay associated with persistent weaknesses in the cryptocurrency marketplace, especially the losses of stake associated with massive hacks and insider fraud in central exchanges. To solve this problem, we created Volentix to provide a comprehensive set of user-friendly tools for every individual: a decentralized exchange for peer-to-peer trading of digital assets (VDEX), a secure downloadable digital wallet (VERTO), an interface for tracking, analyzing, and rating digital assets (VESPUCCI), a platform offering incentives for education, promotion, and further development (VENUE), and a native digital currency to act as a store of value and a means of exchange (VTX). Together, these tools are an effective solution for exchanging value freely and securely without centralized middlemen."
