It is a distributed extensible virtual network, based on the physical network layer and the ISP network layer.\r\n\r\nVision Network uses blockchain technology, distributed networks, and asymmetric encryption provides distributed services such as Proxy/VPN, multi-layer anonymous network, IM, DNS, even CDN, and DDoS defense, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Voken \u2013 Unique token in the Vision Network ecosystem with stable value scale will be used in the entire ecology and produce an incentive effect.
