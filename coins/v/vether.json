        "en": "A strictly-scarce Ethereum-based asset.\r\nVether is designed to be a store-of-value with properties of strict scarcity, unforgeable costliness and a fixed emission schedule. Vether mimics characteristics of Bitcoin, where miners compete to expend capital to acquire newly-minted coins and chase ever-decreasing margins. Instead of expending capital, Vether participants compete to purchase it by destroying capital on-chain. As a result, all units of Vether are acquired at-cost and by anyone. This mechanism is called Proof-of-Value."
