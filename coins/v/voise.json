Even though VOISE tokens remain the primary mode of value exchange on the platform, people can still purchase music using other cryptocurrencies and even fiat. By including fiat payments, VOISE is ensuring that those who are not used to conducting cryptocurrency transactions aren\u2019t left out and at the same time, it also acts as a gateway for them to enter the blockchain and digital currency domain.
