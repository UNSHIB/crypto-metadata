        "en": "Voltbit was created as a way to help combat poverty and climate change.\r\nIn many Third-World countries and under-developed areas, having electricity is currently a struggle due to lack of funding or availability. \r\n\r\nWith Voltbit, we aim to change this. A 1% fee on every transaction goes to a charity wallet.\r\n\r\nWe also have \"auto staking\" where you earn passive Voltbit tokens as every transaction has a 3% fee that redistributes tokens, reducing the total amount in circulation. There is finally another 3% fee that goes to burning tokens, removing them from circulation.\r\n\r\nTotaling a 7% overall fee per transaction."
