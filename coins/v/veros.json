        "en": "Veros is a zero-fee fundraising platform where the majority of all advertisement revenue funnels directly into fundraisers launched on the platform. Veros was built from the ashes of an old project that was abandoned by its creators. When the previous founders took the money and ran, they left behind a community of people in shambles, without a hope for revival. From this, Veros Digital Hearts was born. Veros Digital Hearts converted all of the worthless tokens from the old project into new VRS tokens, ready to be used on the Veros global fundraising platform. Veros\u2019 core essence is to proliferate philanthropy. It is where we came from, and where we are headed. \r\n\r\nVeros | VRS \u2013 will help to unite the efforts of many companies to combat environmental problems and create an ecological community in which only companies that adhere to the principle of environmental friendliness can join.
