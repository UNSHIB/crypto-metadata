        "en": "Vires.finance is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol based on Waves blockchain, where users, wallets and dapps can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to take a loan in an overcollateralized manner.\r\n\r\nVires.finance utilises common pool-based mechanics where all the funds deposited participate in interest-bearing activities equally. The greater the demand for borrowing an asset is, the greater APY lenders get in return. \r\n\r\nUsers can lend and borrow the following tokens: WAVES, USDN, USDT, ETH, USDC, EURN and BTC."
