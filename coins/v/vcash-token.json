        "en": "VCash is a product that implements MimbleWimble technology with characteristics of Bitcoin. It inherits Bitcoin\u2019s distribution mechanism and uses Grin's MimbleWimble implementation. \r\nVCash adopts Merged Mining method to mine coins alongside Bitcoin, that is, VCash blocks are computed when Bitcoin blocks are computed. In general, POW chains need to take into consideration that there is a 51% risk of attack on the network. Since Bitcoin has the largest number of miners in the world whereby hash power is broadly distributed, VCash can easily obtain most of Bitcoin\u2019s hash power with the support of the Bitcoin mining pool. This means VCash possesses the same level of security as Bitcoin hence launching a 51% attack on it would be equally difficult. \r\nThe goal of VCash is to be the most private and secure chain for storing values."
