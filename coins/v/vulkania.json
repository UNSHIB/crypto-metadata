        "en": "Vulkania app allows you to create a fully functional blockchain dashboard for a specific token. We call it DAAS (Dashboard As A Service). Dashboards come with a set of tools and can be fully personalized. In the end, every token will have a unique website with aggregated data coming from a lot of sources, including decentralized (blockchain) and centralized data (APIs).\r\nDashboard creation is available for crypto founders or their community. What we are building offers the following advantages for both:\r\n\u2022 Token visibility\r\n\u2022 Community engagement\r\n\u2022 Data tracking\r\n\u2022 Time saving (zero development)\r\n\u2022 Easy to set up (two clics)"
