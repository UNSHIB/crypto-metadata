        "en": "Car Coin is a token used across a network where consumers are connected with live inventory from Auto Dealers. Our concept is developed with blockchain technology where the auto dealer stakes CCM in order to list their inventory and gain access to the network. Consumers use CCM to purchase vehicles, list vehicles on a classified platform and increase their buying power on a vehicle purchase through CCM staking. Car Coin will provide liquidity and credit access to consumers as well as create transparency across the automotive industry."
