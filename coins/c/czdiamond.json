        "en": "Darkside Finance is the only truly user-owned yield farm. All pools and farms yield two tokens! CZDIAMOND is an ownership token, and stakers receive 75% of all deposit fees and 50% of all other platform revenue as USDC dividends. DARK token price support receives 25% of deposit fees and 50% of other platform revenue. Darkside Finance is Layer 3 in the yield farming system by Sugandese Tokens. The other layers have been PolyWantsACracker and Stadium Arcadium. In this layer, the platform adds an on-chain OTC engine, slots and more gambling games, and a Lootbox contract for indirect buybacks."
