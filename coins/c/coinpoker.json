        "en": "CoinPoker is a worldwide cryptocurrency-based online poker room that\u2019s launching its ICO this November. We\u2019re operating with Ethereum Smart Contracts and once the room will have been launched, we\u2019re going to ensure full transparency via the use of blockchains. The RNG will be visible on blockchains, and the players will be able to see it after the game. That together with the pain-free transactions thanks to cryptocurrency will solve many of the problems that online poker has been facing. \u2022\tTransactions will be immediate + accessible worldwide; \u2022\tRnG will be visible for transparency; \u2022\tAnonymity will be guaranteed; \u2022\tFair play at the tables will be ensured. + HUGE Grand Opening Events with awesome prizes (15% of tokens distributed during the ICO will be returned during these tournaments). What makes us different from other ICOs? Well, for one, we\u2019ve got our MVP (minimum viable product, in our case \u2013 an app) ready to go, and we\u2019ll be launching our MVP with play money before our actual ICO start!\r\n\r\n"
