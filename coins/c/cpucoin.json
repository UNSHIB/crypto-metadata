Their technology enables anyone to install a miner client and collect funds for their unused computing time, essentially transforming the project into a sort of Airbnb for CPU/GPU computing resources as well as providing a platform for automatically deploying and scaling Decentralized Services and DApps.\r\n\r\nA new certified utility token called CPU Coin will enable organizations of all sizes to pay as they go, a highly convenient feature that is not yet available in the market.
