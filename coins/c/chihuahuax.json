        "en": "Chihuahuax aims to become the leading community social token of the Avalanche Blockchain, paving the way to additionnal big projects on a midterm run.\r\n\r\nOur launch mechanism was designed to avoid whales and bot, making it a fair launch for everyone. 10% of the supply has been burnt at launch as well.\r\n\r\nRedistribution is at the heart of what we do with CHIHUA. We believe that DeFi should empower people rather than investment funds. DeFi is here to place the liquidity in YOUR hands and not in the hands of already rich asset managers. That is why we based the success of our token on its community and it\u2019s capacity to hold the assets and get rewarded automatically in USDT."
