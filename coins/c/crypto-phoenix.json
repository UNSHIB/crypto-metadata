        "en": "CRYPTO PHOENIX is a token that is aiming to bridge the gap between a utility token and a meme token. The token is fully decentralized and we rely on our community to help make the token a success. This token aims to take all of the positive traits of popular \"meme\" coins and add to them, with things like our automatic burn mechanic. Our ultimate purpose is to create a token that will be used by many for everyday purchases, and also as an investment vehicle. We want our community to benefit from not just holding our token but actually being able to use it in real life applications."
