        "en": "In the simplest of terms, carbon neutrality means having net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve this, you have to balance carbon emissions with carbon removal. For every amount of carbon, a company or country produces, it should be taking steps to remove the same amount of carbon from the atmosphere if it wants to achieve carbon neutrality.\r\n\r\n$CBC (Carbon Coin) is released on the basis of BINANCE SMART CHAIN platform and fully complies with BSC20* standard. $CBC is completely decentralized, and all decisions are made by a community poll. Our goal is to reduce pollution by donating to organizations involved in promoting carbon neutrality. These organizations will be voted by the community."
