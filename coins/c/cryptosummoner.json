        "en": "Crypto Summoner is a Click-2-Earn Blockchain game running on the BSC with exceptional graphics and veteran blockchain developers. Over 18 Gods to summon rarity ranging from Uncommon to Legendary! \r\n\r\nHow is CryptoSummoner different from other Click 2 Earn Games?\r\n\r\n- The key difference is that we are in this for the long haul and that we are making the gods to be an NFT that\u2019s unique and sustainable.\r\n- The key to Crypto Summoner is Rarity. We only allow 50,000 Gods to be minted\r\nWe think that over the years, each god would be massively more valuable than the price that you can summon today! \r\n- Current Click to Earn games in the market do not work, once they run out of players, then the games will end and the price will crash.\r\n- We won\u2019t be doing that. We will transition from a Click-to-Earn game to a PvP-to-Earn Game. \r\n- We will rely less on the game rewards and the rewards will come from the coins that players stake for executing a battle"
