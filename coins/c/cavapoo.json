        "en": "Fair launched on June 1 2021, Cavapoo ($CAVA) is the new dog in town bridging the crypto space with real-world events. $CAVA is fully decentralized and is on a mission to bring awareness to actively promoting and encouraging the funding of charities and acknowledging what\u2019s currently happening in the world.\r\n\r\n$CAVA TOKEN\r\n\r\nRapid Rewards (RR)\r\nFor every transaction in $CAVA\u2019s (buy or sell), 3% of the transaction is distributed to existing holders. Which means you earn more CAVA by holding.\r\n\r\nAutomated LP\r\nFor every transaction, 4% will be distributed towards liquidity that exchange use and more accessible for holders' transactions to go through.\r\n\r\nCharity Driven\r\nCAVA aims to bridge the gap between crypto and real world events. We will achieve this by actually doing in person charity events, food drives, fundraisers and more.\r\n\r\nSecure & Safe\r\nCAVA smart contract is audited, liquidity is locked, and LP (Liquidity Pool) tokens burned. That means zero risks to our holders, and we are safe.\""
