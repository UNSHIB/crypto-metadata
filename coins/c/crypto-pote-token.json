        "en": "The crypto pote token is a BEP20 token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain network.\r\nInitially, there were 10,000,000 POPEs in circulation. A 2% fee is charged on each transaction and redistributed as follows :\r\n- Half of these fees are burned, reducing the number of POPEs in circulation to create an everincreasing scarcity phenomenon.\r\n- The other half of these fees are redistributed to the holders in proportion to their holdings in relation.\r\nFrom the date of listing, the POPE will be available for pre-sale at 1 USDT per POPE for up to 2 months.\r\nAfter these 2 months, the unsold POPEs will be burned as well as those of the creator's wallet who will only hold a maximum of 10% of the supply.\r\n40% of the pre-sale money will be used as guarantee in case of dump. A buy limit order will be adjusted every week according to the number of POPE in the supply.\r\nThus, investors are guaranteed to have a total sale of their pope at a minimum price that is constantly increasing thanks to the burn of the POPE on each transaction."
