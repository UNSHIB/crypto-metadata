Governance is based on the DAO model and supports 2 types of votes: direct protocol control by CGT-holders and community service polls. Curio StableCoin Protocol allows people to use Security Tokens (supported Curio Car Tokens) as collateral to generate Curio StableCoin, and also make deposits to Curio StableCoin to generate passive income."
