        "en": "Crypto Kombat is the first of its kind game on the Ethereum blockchain, where the heroes of the battles are influencers, famous developers, creators of crypto projects, exchanges, and entrepreneurs from the crypto space!\r\n\r\nKOMBAT is an internal game's token. KOMBATs can be traded on exchanges as well as used in YeldFarming. KOMBATs can be staked in contract to receive rewards in VOMBATs. And VOMBAT is needed in order to mint NFT cards of your favorite heroes. Each crypto-hero card has 4 levels of a rarity - Genesis, Epic, Rare and Common. The last three types can be received by each player by accumulating the required number of VOMBATs. Genesis cards are issued in one copy and must be transferred to those who are depicted on them.\r\n\r\nElon Musk, Pavel Durov, Charlie Lee, Vitalik Buterin, and dozens of other heroes are waiting for you in Crypto Kombat! Game Hero \u0441ards can be transferred, exchanged, or traded on the OpenSea marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay will be reminiscent of the classic rock-paper-scissors, where players send their hero card to meet other players' cards, and by comparing the characteristics of Intelligence, Power, and Influence, they will compete with opponents with some random factors.\r\n\r\nJoin the growing active Crypto Kombat community! Our goal is to tell everyone in a playful way about the people who changed the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain!\r\n"
