        "en": "By providing a truly decentralized and scalable framework, combined with an accessible and intuitive user interface, Cypherium lays a comprehensive foundation for developers to create groundbreaking apps capable of transforming the future of business, law, and enterprise solutions.\r\n\r\nUsing a hybrid consensus mechanism that utilizes both Proof-of-Work and HotStuff, our blockchain is designed to achieve commercialization viability by maximizing both decentralization and scalability without sacrificing one for the other. Unlike many second- and third-generation blockchains that abandon Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original permissionless, trustless consensus mechanism, Cypherium is built on the valuable innovations of previous blockchains.\r\n"
