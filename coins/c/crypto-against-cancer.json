        "en": "Crypto Against Cancer (CACT) has been created by experienced members of the crypto community who wanted to make a real impact to cancer research and treatment around the world. It is one of the first tokens to reward holders with BNB through a reward pool, automatically generated through the smart contract. With every transaction 8.5% is collected and stored within the contract's BNB reward pool and is then made available for token holders to claim from periodically. In addition1% of transactions is reflected to holders. A further 8.5% is automatically added to the liquidity pool, 0.5% used for development and marketing and most importantly of all, 1.5% for our cancer charity fund."
