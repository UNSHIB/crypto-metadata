        "en": "Bridging fungible or non-fungible tokens is quite a laborious process. There are a variety of bridges that focus on connecting selected networks or support only selected tokens. As a user, you need to know which token you want to move over which bridge to another network. The Cross-Chain Bridge v2.0 has an ambitious goal: It should be possible to move as many tokens as possible to almost any network.\r\n\r\nThe Cross-Chain Bridge will attract and incentivize all players to participate in the ecosystem. Similar to projects launching tokens on Uniswap or a DEX, communities and/or creators will be able to add their own token via the Cross-Chain Bridge intuitively and permissionlessly, benefiting from greater accessibility and security. Meanwhile, yield farmers AND projects will be incentivized to provide liquidity with fee-participation and yield farming."
