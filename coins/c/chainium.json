It\u2019s sets out our clear goal for global market growth.\r\n\r\nWeOwn works for businesses\u200a\u2014\u200abusinesses is about ownership and they need to take ownership of their investors and investor engagement\r\nWeOwn works for investors\u200a\u2014\u200ainvestors own their shares and, by buying shares, they own a part of the business they have invested in\r\nWeOwn works for developers\u200a\u2014\u200adevelopers own the solutions they will build on our blockchain\r\nWeOwn enables us to be playful in our marketing communications. Check out our new website domain or consider campaigns with messages like \u2018Own shares in businesses you really believe in\u2019 or \u2018We own shares\u2019. Instead of buying/selling/trading shares, why not \u2018Own it\u2019. We\u2019re going to have a lot of fun with this!\r\n\r\nwe feel that Chainium is too limiting a name for our business. It\u2019s too blockchain-centric. It\u2019s too same-same. It\u2019s too small a name for our global ambitions. As a result of our rebranding will change as of 2pm UTC Wednesday the 25th of July."
