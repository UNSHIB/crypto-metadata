        "en": "CardanoEvo is a community-driven project, reflecting not only the Cardano ($ADA) token, but also the ethics and charitable status of our \u2018parent\u2019 coin. The Dev team have worked tirelessly to build a community of investors focused on the long-term future of the project, enjoying passive income from their hold, whilst being involved in development of our web presence, advertising strategies, merchandising store, future website-based NFT marketplace and further functionality & use of the imminent Cardano blockchain release.\r\n\r\nCardanoEvo is a frictionless yield and liquidity generation smart contract which rewards holders with reflections in Cardano ($ADA) reflections. The transaction taxation funds those reflections, as well as adding liquidity and marketing budgets. The token has investor protection built into the contract, with wallet hold and transaction limits, as well as an anti-bot function embedded into its code. The contract also uses a manually-activated burn function in order to provide deflation as and when appropriate.\r\n"
