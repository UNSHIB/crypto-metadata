        "en": "CYBEX is a decentralized digital asset exchange based on graphene technology, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a> will migrate to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a> when it goes online. CYBEX aims to improve the liquidity of cryptographic assets that are more transparent and secure than their current counterparts on the market. CYBEX is an ecosystem. Its core is based on the graphene technology blockchain, which is efficient and secure, and can use its entrusted shareholding consensus to extend more than 100,000 transactions per second. CYBEX uses a graphene-based LMAX high-speed coupling engine to achieve millions of transactions per second. System nodes will provide efficient and secure blockchain packaging services through <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake\">DPOS consensus</a>. In the future, with the adoption of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a> will be more scalable."
