        "en": "Collateral is a next-generation payment gateway that acts as a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds \u2014 by allowing users to store, stake, loan, and spend their digital assets anywhere, anytime.\r\nThrough Collateral Pay, users can safely lock their cryptocurrencies in a smart contract via the Collateral app. Collateral will then make a fiat payment directly to any merchant that supports Collateral, and users can retrieve their cryptocurrencies by repaying what was spent.\r\n\r\nll of this is done at the point of sale \u2014 meaning no need to pre-arrange anything. This allows merchants to easily reach long-term cryptocurrency holders, while users can extract spending power from their assets without losing out on its long-term appreciation.\r\nAmong its numerous other products, Collateral is also introducing Collateral Loan \u2014 a solution that allows users to take out low CLV, low-interest loans using their cryptocurrencies to make fiat payments to merchants that don\u2019t yet accept Collateral. Users retain ownership of their collateral while it appreciates, and can retrieve their deposit by simply repaying their loan.\r\nCOLL is the native utility token of the Collateral ecosystem. COLL holders benefit from impressive staking APRs and receive a share of the fee derived from merchant fees and sold COLLs. On top of this, COLL tokens can be used to earn COLLG \u2014 a secondary token used for platform governance.\r\nCOLL staking pools will be available on the same day as TGE, ensuring users can stake their tokens to earn a reward from day 1."
