That might be difficult given the traditional systems of payments. A large number of transaction charges would make it burdensome. However, it is completely possible to use Zoomcoin.\r\n\r\nZoomcoin makes product tracking possible. So, there can be a giant public repository of records that will help sellers know who has purchased their content and when. and easy to use in social reward."
