        "en": "ZionCoin's design philosophy is to use profit incentive mechanism to construct a fast, low cost, efficient, safe and reliable public blockchain ecosystem which satisfies large-scale daily business needs. These requirements include, but are not limited to, trading and clearance of various types of assets, as well as redundant storage of information.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in order to protect the autonomy right of the participants in the ecosystem, ZionCoin adopts the multi-chain architecture design principle of main chain plus parallel subchains, which provides the subchain ecosystem with an independent operating system of asset transactions, clearance and storage. This mechanism not only significantly reduce the systemic risk, but will further improve systemic efficiency."
