        "en": "Zero Utility Token is a human collective of artists, developers and active community members that aim to bring real usecase to the DeFi landscape through innovative products. Our first product \"\"NFT Multisend\"\" is currently live and offers users to send any ERC720/721/1155 NFT tokens to several addresses at once all within one transaction. All proceeds from products go to buy and burn ZUT tokens. We value our community above all else and build our products with them first in mind. Being one of the only rug-proof smart contracts to date, this format of community building will launch DeFi to small communities all over the world. Our NFT initiative is the most ambitious in the space having an in-house group of artists creating original pieces that increase in value as users burn minted copies of their NFT for ETH. \r\n\r\nPure community, all transparency and TRUTH! ZUT!\""
