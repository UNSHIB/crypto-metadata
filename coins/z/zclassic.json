        "en": "Zclassic is a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\">Zcash</a> founded by Rhett Creighton but with the 20% founders\u2019 reward and slow start removed. Miners are simply earning their fair reward, we believe they deserve it, and the coin development can be supported by the community. ZCL also differs from ZEC by removing the slow start (source), we are not trying to deliberately engineer scarcity: The Market decides the price. We are using the same parameters which were produced in the now famous secure \"trusted setup meeting\" (source) where Peter Todd participated, and he confirmed to us (source) they are safe to use. If just one of the participants kept their key secret and destroyed it, the whole system is secure.\r\n\r\nZcash is a cryptocurrency run by the Zero Coin Inc. In order to fund their operations, a 20% mining \u201cFounder\u2019s Reward\u201d is included. Every block, in order to maintain consensus, miners running the Zcash code send 20% of their newly mined rewards to an address controlled by the Zero Coin Inc. Because the Zcash source code is open source, Zclassic simply removes the 20% Founder\u2019s Reward. This gives people the option to mine a blockchain using the same technology of Zcash, but without paying the 20% Founder\u2019s Reward.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Zclassic is to stay as similar to Zcash from a technology perspective, but to never take any pre-mine, founder\u2019s-reward or any other kind of fee that goes to a small group of individuals with special permissions whether elected, appointed, or otherwise."
