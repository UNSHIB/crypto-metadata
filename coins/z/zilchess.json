        "en": "ZilChess is a decentralized chess platform running on the Zilliqa blockchain. Players can bet prefixed amount of ZILs in specific 'chess rooms', being coupled with other players with similar ELO, win 90% of the total bet amount on that board in case of victory. The platform has an equity token which gives the holders the benefit to cash-in monthly dividends accumulated by the platform. People can get ZCHs either playing games on the platform, or providing liquidity to the ZilSwap ZCH pool, or buying them on ZilSwap"
