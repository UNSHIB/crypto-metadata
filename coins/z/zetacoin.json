        "en": "Zetacoin is a SHA256 based cryptocurrency, which is the same hashing algorithm used in the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. \r\n\r\nIt features high speed transaction time and difficulty adjustment with a yearly inflationary rate of 1 million coins. \r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the inflationary coins would keep the Zetacoin network strong instead of depending on paying miners via transaction fees.\r\n"
