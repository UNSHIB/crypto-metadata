        "en": "TopBidder is a radical auction protocol based on NonFungible Token standards. It adopts the theory of Radical Market and implements a non-permanent owned crypto assets\u2019 (Radical NFT, referred to as rNFT) production and auction mechanism.\r\n\r\nWhenever someone bids, the last bidder can get 30% of the price difference with the current bid as subsidy, the other 18% of the price difference will go to the pool reserve and the revenue will be distributed once a week through BID token yield farming, and 2% will be the inviter reward, 50% will paid to the artist.\r\n\r\nFor artists who have passed platform certification to issue rNFTs, the bidders will have the opportunity to get BIDs for each bid."
