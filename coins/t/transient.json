        "en": "Transient is the Smart Contracts Global Marketplace - an ecosystem that gives non-coders the ability to create their own Next-Gen Contracts in the digital world. Increasing blockchain adoption across every sphere of industry and life.\r\n\r\nTSC-Core is the 1st Transient dApp and it allows users to create smart contracts using different features (transfer, deposit and digital signature). All without coding.\r\n\r\nCryptoPool is the 2nd dApp - it gives users the ability to crate price prediction pools for tokens.\r\n\r\nEsports - the 3rd dApp - is similar to CryptoPool in terms of pooling but it is the bridge between users and AAA games (League of Legends, DOTA, Counter Strike and others).\r\n\r\nNDA dApp - the 4th one, gives two parts the possibility of singing a contract easily through the blockchain."
