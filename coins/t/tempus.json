        "en": "Tempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed rate protocol built on the Ethereum network. Most forms of yield farming return a variable rate of yield. This means that depositors can be subject to unpredictable fluctuations in their returns. Currently, there is no easy capital efficient way to obtain a fixed yield or otherwise speculate on the receivable rewards. This is where Tempus steps in. Tempus has three different use cases, each of which offers a unique value proposition:\r\n\r\n- Fix your future yield using any supported Yield Bearing Token (such as stETH, cDai)\r\n- Speculate on the rate of future yield of any supported Yield Bearing Token\r\n- Provide liquidity to earn additional swap fees (on top of yield earned through yield farming protocols) by depositing any supported Yield Bearing Token\r\n\r\nBuilt on Balancer's v2 Stable Pools, Tempus\u2019 Principal-Yield AMM dramatically increases capital efficiency, so that liquidity providers will be able to continue earning the entire underlying yield, as well as Tempus yield, at the same time."
