        "en": "Titano is launching the new frontier of staking tokens which will literally change the way token holders become Stakeholders. By releasing an innovative holding system which includes a positive rebase formula, Titano is creating a new type of elastic Token, named AutoStake Token. \r\n\r\nThe AutoStake Token is an elastic token which, through a positive rebase formula, allows $TITANO holders earn staking rewards just by holding the token.\r\n\r\nThe AutoStake feature is bringing the highest APY in the market 102,483.58% which is worth a daily ROI (Daily Return On Investment) of 1.8999%. This elevated gain is sustained by the RFV (Risk Free Value) which receives a percentage dedicated to create a collateral value for the generated APY from the token trading volume."
