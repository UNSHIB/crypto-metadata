        "en": "TRAVA is the world\u2019s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their  own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a  flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on  financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users. "
