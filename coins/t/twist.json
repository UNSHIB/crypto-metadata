        "en": "TWIST is a blockchain based decentralised platform and ecosystem which aims to increase the accessibility of the blockchain through innovative services and features targeted at casual cryptocurrency users and programmers interested in utilising blockchain technology. Features such as TWIST ID strive to simplify the payment process and make it more familiar and friendly to create and send transactions. TWIST\r\nDATA aims to provide a simple and clear interface to allow users and programmers to read and write encrypted data to the blockchain. TWIST API will provide a modern,\r\nlanguage agnostic programming interface which can be utilised by developers to integrate their applications with the TWIST blockchain. Further features and services are planned and will be developed as the project progresses. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal for TWIST is to achieve widespread adoption and to create a thriving self-sustaining ecosystem where TWIST coins are used to pay for both blockchain based, and off-chain features, the fees of which are allocated as rewards to node owners for providing services and for stabilising and securing the network."
