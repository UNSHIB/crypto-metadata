        "en": "The sharing economy has been popular all over the world in recent years. Airbnb and Uber are the ancestors of the sharing economy. Based on this, TTSharer utilizes the concept of sharing economy and the blockchain to build a globally shared economic ecosystem. Depend on immutable, irreversible and transparent features of the blockchain and the encryption algorithm to take over the trust between people.  \r\n\r\nIn the everything-shareable ecosystem of TTSharer, we have developed a sharer plan that covers several life perspectives of clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment. We have a corresponding mature application to TTHouse. In addition, TTMall, TTPay, TTCar, TTTravel are being developed. Everyone is a sharer that can be our live advertisement. The sharer can transform the online and offline interpersonal relationships into the real economy in the TTSharer ecosystem so that they can use the interactive mining (PoI) approach to gain new income resources and then activate consumer scene and create consumer demand through the token.  \r\n\r\nWe look forward to developing token economy model in every city thru the concept of sharing economy + blockchain in the ecosystem of TTSharer to create more application scenarios for each of the user/sharer."
