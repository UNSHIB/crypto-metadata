        "en": "Tripio is the first travel marketplace based on the blockchain. It leverages the decentralized network provided by blockchain technologies to directly connect global customers and service providers. Moreover, it builds a service ecosystem based on transparent, tamper-resistant trust and incentives.\r\n\r\nThe blockchain technologies Tripio leverages help reduce transactional and operational costs in travel industries, as well as improve customer experience in their respective products and services. On the Tripio platform, a service provider can publish her unique service terms and conditions using smart contracts. From the moment a purchase initiates to the end of the travel, every step along the way can be enforced and monitored by smart contracts. Should disputes arise, Tripio provides dispute resolution by means of community selfgovernment mechanisms.\r\n\r\nTripio comprises of its dApps and a set of Tripio Protocols that forms the basis of the new ecosystem. The Tripio dApp and the Tripio Protocals are powered by the ERC-20 utility token called the TRIO token. Customers may use Tripio dApps directly. At the same, any third-party may build its own dApp by leveraging the open Ethereum protocols. "
