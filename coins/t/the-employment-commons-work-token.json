        "en": "The $WORK Rewards (\u201c$WORK\u201d) of the Employment Commons (the \u201cCommons\u201d) aligns economic incentives between Commons Members to support the future of the independent, self-sovereign worker. There are two types of Members in the Commons; Employee and Coalition. \r\n\r\n- Employee Members are independent workers actively co-employed through the ecosystem\r\n- Coalition Members provide new Member referrals, technology and/or services to the Commons\r\n- Initially, Employee Memberships are limited to those who are qualified to work in the United States\r\n- The Commons anticipates eventual global expansion\r\n- All U.S. and international persons, organizations, and DAOs are qualified to be Coalition Members\r\n\r\nThe Commons economic model allows for Stakeholder Capitalism in a collectively owned, for-purpose (and profit) digital employment cooperative, as discussed in the Opolis Off-White Paper. $WORK is designed as a Cooperative Patronage Rewards token used as a means of incentivizing stakeholders to engage in certain patronage activities deemed valuable by the Commons. $WORK tokens are a unit of account to determine the amount of patronage  profits a Member is entitled to if/when they are declared by the Commons. \r\n\r\nFunctionally, the Commons offers Employee Members the ability to:\r\n- Reap the benefits of group purchasing power for reduced costs on products and services (e.g. group healthcare insurance, technology tools, and shared services)\r\n- Share in profits with other stakeholders based on patronage\r\n- Become an \u201cowner\u201d in a shared network that protects its Members\u2019 best interests\r\n- Participate in the governance of the Commons\r\n\r\nMembers earn $WORK for patronage in the Commons ecosystem via: \r\n- Using the Commons for the processing of payroll, employment benefits, and shared services as an Employee Member\r\n- Direct referrals of new Employee Members \r\n- Staking rewards by staking $WORK\r\n- The Commons Trustee, Opolis, Inc., as a team member, contributor,  advisor, or shareholder"
