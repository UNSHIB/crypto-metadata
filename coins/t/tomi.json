        "en": "TOMI Token is a decentralized coin that aims to power scalable projects with transformational impact on their communities, regions, and the world.\r\nAt the core of this project is the desire to eliminate current crypto market greed in fees and educate people about the complex concept of wealth on the way.\r\nThere are billions of people globally without the tools to participate in the financial system meaningfully. It could come from a simple lack of knowledge and a lack of access to how to navigate the investment scene. Accordingly, most people end up working their entire lives in careers that fulfill their momentary needs without long-term financial security. Wealth creation skills are often elusive for the majority. This is why we decided to launch this ambitious project that seeks to fill this niche. The word TOMI is not a term of endearment but has a specific meaning in what we seek to achieve.\r\nTOMI is a Japanese term for wealth. Creating true wealth is no walk in the park. When done right, generational wealth can empower several generations and allow people to have stability in their lives. The ability to create money while you sleep is one of the hallmarks of wealth building."
