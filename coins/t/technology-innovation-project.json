        "en": "TIP is a key economic element within the platform, and is used in various businesses such as cryptocurrency payments, coupons, mileage, earning, and discounts.\r\n\r\nBy applying the transparency, security, and safety of blockchain technology to a 1: 1 connection between consumers and companies, it inevitably reduces brokerage costs and leads the standardization of blockchain finance.\r\n\r\nBy integrating various fragmented business data (points, coupons, mileage, earning, discounts, etc.), it is possible to create an infrastructure that can be used anywhere and advance into the real economy.\r\n\r\nA new economic ecosystem that has never been seen is realized through TIP."
