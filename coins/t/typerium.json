Typerium will keep your content safe from intellectual property thieves.\r\n\r\nCreative Software\r\nOur integrated and intuitive design software allows creators to produce high-quality visual content for any platform without needing any previous design experience.\r\n\r\nMarketplace\r\nWe\u2019re developing a decentralised marketplace that not only protects the intellectual property rights of content creators, but provides them with an 85% commission on all sales. There are no waiting times for payouts, and 5% of each sale is redistributed among those who use the platform.\r\n\r\nSocial Media Network\r\nWe\u2019re creating a community-driven social network that rewards users, so you don\u2019t have to rely on just your sales. You\u2019ll also be rewarded for your contributions.\r\n\r\nIntegrated Ecosystem\r\nWe\u2019re creating a global network of creators using a single currency, TYPE Tokens. All content within the Typerium eco-system is bought and sold with TYPE Tokens. These tokens can be exchanged for fiat currency through exchanges at any time.\r\n"
