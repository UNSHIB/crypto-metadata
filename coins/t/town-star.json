        "en": "Gala Games' Town Star, a new game from the creative minds behind Farmville by Zynga, is a masterpiece of town-building, organization and time management.\r\n\r\nThrough the course of each competitive game, players build towns from scratch by placing buildings such as farms, ranches, production facilities, even power plants. By managing the automatic flow of their town's workers, players are able to farm resources that are refined into goods, which are then crafted into commodities by buildings of increasing cost and workers of increasing specialty. By delivering goods to neighboring cities and cooperating with neighboring towns, players are able to earn money to continue development and stars, which determine the ultimate winner of each Town Star game."
