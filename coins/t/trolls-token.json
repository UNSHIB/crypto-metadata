The days when you could have fun online without being cancelled. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Trolls Token we aim to create a thriving community based around collectable NFT's. These NFT's can be collected as achievements, via contests, and by joining our monthly NFT Give Aways.\r\n\r\nThe Trolls Token and Community is being developed by a team with a dream, and we will not stop until we reach our goals!"
