        "en": "Tag Protocol project is an endeavor to find answers and resolve some of the issues plaguing the current store of value coins. Our vision is to build a coin ecosystem that is blockchain agnostic. A coin ecosystem that can deploy and migrate it\u2019s smart contract structures to any SmartChain Platform based upon community consensus. Any individual in the Tagcoin community can propose a migration from the active host blockchain to another blockchain along with their reasoning and the community can deliberate, analyze and vote for or against this proposal. This ensures the community maintains a consistent coin tokenomics that they can deploy their savings to, while also having the ability to adapt or migrate to the most advanced blockchain technology available based upon changing needs identified by the community based upon consensus.\r\n\r\nThe logical fallacy being that a good store of value token discovers value from the continuity of it\u2019s tokenomics and that the blockchain is merely a host that provides required security and settlement network for transfer and storage of coins for the community around it."
