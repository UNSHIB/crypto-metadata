        "en": "Transfercoin is a PoW/PoS hybrid cryptocurrency based on the X11 hashing algorithm. There is no premine or IPO. The first 15,000 PoW and PoS blocks offer a reward of 300 TX per block. After that, each subsequent PoS block will be rewarded with 15 TX.\r\n\r\nTransfer send is performed by Masternodes to ensure anonymity. To run a Masternode, it will require 100,000 TX. 50% of mining rewards will be given to Masternode operators."
