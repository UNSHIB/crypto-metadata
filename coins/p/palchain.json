        "en": "PalChain is dedicated to creating an autonomous, open and transparent one-to-one video social platform.\r\n\r\nPalChain differs from traditional Internet products in that it is an open, transparent and token organization representing all the interests of the PalChain video social platform. PALT pioneered the Consumption is reward model, giving most PALT back to community users in the form of rewards. More particularly, the Palchain community gives 80% of its income back to PALT holders, distributing it in proportion to the composition of the income."
