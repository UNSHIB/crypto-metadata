        "en": "PolkaParty is made for you, as the platform allows users to gain access to all features of DeFi (swapping, liquidity providing, yield farming, NFT\u2019s, etc) by just joining a single party!\u200c\r\nOur aim is to create an easy to use, user friendly experience that allows anybody to hop into a party, chat with members, and be rewarded for group efforts. We\u2019ve found in our research that there has been a consistently growing barrier of entry for understanding the technicalities of using specific DeFi features.\r\n\u200cOur solution is to create a platform that allows anybody to create or join a party with respectable friends, family, and most importantly DeFi veterans, navigating the landscape of endless profits from the smart decisions. No longer will you be frustrated with DeFiety (DeFi-Anxiety), or FOMO into bad moves from not understanding what to do, since you\u2019ll be able to research, chat, and vote with your fellow partiers!"
