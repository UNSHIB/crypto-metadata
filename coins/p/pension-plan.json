        "en": "Pension Plan has the newest technology of coding, which allows high redistribution of 7 % to its holders in Ethereum. Furthermore, the Pension Plan token contributes 1 % towards clinical research and buyback of 0.5 % shrinks the supply constantly. This token is perfect for passive income and the goal of the project is to create a platform, which would allow holders to pay directly by debit card with redistributed Ethereum within seconds.\r\n\r\nThe code of Pension plan is unique and was built by our team.\r\nYou will not find anything with the same functionalities. This ERC-20 token works best,\r\nwhen you hold it in your wallet, which guarantees you receiving the redistribution.\r\nThe redistribution is initiated, when 1 ETH is collected from all transactions.\r\n"
