        "en": "ProjectX solves the problems associated with the lack of transparency and complications in the NFT market by making NFT investments liquid, accessible, and secure through its unique and dynamic NFT-pegged ETFs. Additionally, it makes NFT collecting more lucrative and beneficial for all by offering an array of liquidity mining & rewards farming programs. Due to the NFT/ DeFi nature of the project, ProjectX in particular addresses  the market of cryptocurrency trading and yield-based investments (specifically to the DeFi and NFT market).  \r\n\r\nBy further developing the use of indexes and ETFs, it aims to create different themed pools of NFTs - which include Music,  Digital Art, Sports Cards, and KOL issued NFTs within its unique platform. This development will assist both Institutional and Public adoption - driven by hundreds of large-scale and Tier-1 entertainment corporations ."
