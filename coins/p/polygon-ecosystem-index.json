        "en": "Amun\u2019s Polygon Ecosystem Index (PECO) is composed of the top tokens in the Polygon ecosystem. PECO provides investors with exposure to the leading projects in the Polygon ecosystem through either a Polygon native token or an Ethereum token tied to the Polygon assets. Consisting of 50% Matic, PECO gives holders an alternative to only holding Matic and instead gives them a token that grows with the entire ecosystem, not just the base token. Given Polygon\u2019s low transaction fees and growing ecosystem, we believe that PECO can grow to include a large number of constituents so long as they satisfy Amun\u2019s inclusion criteria."
