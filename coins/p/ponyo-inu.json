The teams motivation for this project is to help protect all the fish in the sea by capitalizing upon the intense anime-centered hype that permeates the Ethereum network. The Ponyo-Inu smart contract has been constructed in a way that every transaction results in donations being sent directly to the Coral Restoration Foundations crypto wallet, all of which is verifiable thanks to the blockchain. The restoration of the corals is the number one driving factor to the team and the project. "
