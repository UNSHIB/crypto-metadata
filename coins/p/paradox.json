        "en": "Paradox Token was created in response to an increasing demand for digital entertainment along the lines of comic, video game, and TV entertainment. All three have been combined into Paradox. Paradox\u2019s soul goal was to create a token that would target several markets and create a unique buzz within the crypto world. Our main goal is to create a series of entertainment starting with a comic series and ending with a TV and video game series. Paradox feels that this idea is unique and one of a kind, to which it will fill the demands of a particular community and in a way satisfying the needs of many consumers. We don\u2019t only want to be another project; we want to become something uniquely profound and a giant amongst our peers, a legacy to be remembered!"
