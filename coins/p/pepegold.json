        "en": "> Old coin with a History - PEPS is not a HYPE, it has been around since 2016 and has always upgraded for the benefit of the project. \r\n> Inflation Controlled distribution - Only 20% of the PEPS Premine is to be used for Presale, Marketing, Team, Development & Swap. The balance Premine is locked for the next 4 years and will be burned to control inflation. The Reward phases also control the initial production leading to even profitability and not spike growth. Limited Marketing spend ensures Investors they reap the maximum profit from trading.\r\n> Real World Adaptability  - PEPS had been accepted in the past in food outlets across the globe through its extensive Merchant Onboarding Programs and will continue to do so but on a bigger, better platform Aviation to Education to Healthcare, PEPS plans to create an ecosystem of Suppliers and Buyers which will be backed with a PEPS VISA CARD that can be topped with PEPS or Fiat and will provide a safe, private and instant usability across the world."
