        "en": "PolyMoon is the first automatically liquidity generating DeFi token on Polygon. It works through applying a 10% tax on each transaction, of which 8% is automatically added to the liquidity pool and 2% is distributed among holders. Various utilities such as staking are excluded from the tax fee and providing liquidity is also tax-free. This way the usability is ensured."
