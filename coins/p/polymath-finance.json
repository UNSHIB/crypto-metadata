        "en": "PolyMath.finance (PMF) tokens are designed to become a source of steady passive income for holders. PMF incurs a 12% sales tax to provide autonomous liquidity (2%), MATIC rewards (6%) and maintenance (2%) while the rest is burnt out of the total supply (2%).\r\n\r\nPMF aims to be a platform that gives small long-term holders a chance by taking away some of the leverage whales can have. We\u2019ve put together what was recently made alt-tokens desirable for investors and have prepared a crypto token based on ETH layer 2!\r\n\r\nOur presale is half of the total supply and there will be no team tokens."
