        "en": "SHIVOM is building the largest genomic and health data hub around the globe by combining blockchain, genomic DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence and cryptography to power secure and personalized medicine. \r\n \r\nEverybody will be able to get their genome sequenced and securely stored, and our ecosystem will offer an open web-marketplace for providers to add their apps and services alongside advanced data analytics. The SHIVOM platform works on principles of collaboration and integrity, allowing people to own, manage and monetize their genomics and health data. As we build this global healthcare ecosystem, we will reach even underserved and low-income countries where such services have not been previously available.\r\nOur solution will create shared value for individuals, not-for-profit organizations, governments, and for-profit entities alike.  \r\n\r\nThe platform is truly pioneering in the way it utilizes blockchain technology, to protect, secure and monetize the donor\u2019s DNA data to drive precision medicine and healthcare forward. \r\n \r\n"
