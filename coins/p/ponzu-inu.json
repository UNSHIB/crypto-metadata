        "en": "PONZU INU is an original character integrating Egyptian motifs, pop culture tropes such as pyramids being constructed by aliens, and crypto idioms such as blasting off into space, as a satirical comment on the Inu mania and \"\"multilevel marketing\"\" involved in the economics of memecoin marketing.\r\n\r\nPONZU INU is a decentralized gameified tokenomics experiment. Designed to positively incentivize buyer psychology through competition and bonuses for smart trading and planned friction on selling mechanics, PONZU is a new form of token. PONZU has ambitions to reach the expanse of space to Pluto, locking liquidity for the long-haul voyage. \r\n\r\nThe PONZU INU team's ambition and plan is to become one of the best branded meme coins within the Defi space."
