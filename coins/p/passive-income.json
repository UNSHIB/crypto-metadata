        "en": "PSI is an innovative Ethereum token that re-imagines the concept of DeFI yield generation and change this to DeFi Passive Income generation.\r\n\r\nThere is no institution or centralized party that shares the fees with PSI. There is no interface needed to receive the fees. No action needs to be taken on the part of the holder other than to hold PSI in a wallet they control. With PSI, there are no vaults that could be hacked and drained or treasury funds that could be messed up. There is only the free market.\r\n\r\nAt its core, PSI charges a 1% transaction fee and re-distributes that fee to existing PSI holders instantly and automatically at the time of each transaction."
