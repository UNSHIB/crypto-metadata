        "en": "Pocket Doge is a multi-reflection token where investors can choose between a number of approved tokens to receive as rewards. Future partnerships with other tokens, who meet our stringent criteria, will allow the community to vote on other projects they would like added to the list of reflection options.\r\n\r\nA blockchain-based game is also being developed, along with an NFT marketplace. Pocket Doge is the first token of the wider Pocket Pets Ecosystem, which will have additional tokens, with specific use-cases, developed in the future."
