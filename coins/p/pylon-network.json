Essentially, Pylon Network is a Neutral Energy DataHub, supported by its decentralized Federated Nodes.\r\n\r\nAll Federated Nodes of Pylon Network are required to stake Pylon Tokens ($PYLNT) for becoming part of the network and will receive 80% of the rewards in the form of Pyloncoin ($PYLNC) - the utility coin of Pylon's Neutral Data Hub."
