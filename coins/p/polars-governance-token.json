        "en": "Polars - the new DeFi platform for creating secure polar tokens, the price of which depends on the results of specific external events. Within the POLARS platform, users can buy, sell and exchange polar tokens, as well as participate in the distribution of the platform's commission income. The first polar token pair available for trading on the POLARS platform are the BLACK and WHITE polar tokens.\r\n\r\nPolars solved the main problem of the prediction market in the Defi space - low liquidity. Due to the fact that at one point in time the interests of all stakeholders intersect in one place, the liquidity of polar tokens becomes over concentrated, and this does not depend on the popularity of an event that affects the price of polar tokens. During testing alone, Polars recorded a trading volume of almost $ 800 million.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of Polars lies in the concept of polar tokens. There are two polar tokens, for example WHITE and BLACK. If the price of WHITE rises, then the price of BLACK falls, and vice versa, if BLACK rises, then WHITE falls by the same amount. But the aggregate price of the two polar tokens remains unchanged. Which token will grow and which will fall is influenced by the results of specific events from the real world - sports competitions, exchange rates, politics and other events in which there are opposing sides."
