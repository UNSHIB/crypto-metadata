        "en": "WeTrust is a collaborative saving and insurance platform. It is autonomous, frictionless, and decentralized. WeTrust utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create a full-stack financial system that leverages existing social capital and trust networks, eliminating the need of a \u201ctrusted third party\u201d, which allows for lower fees, improved incentive structures, decentralized risks, and a greater amount of capital to reside among the participants. WeTrust\u2019s first product is a Rotating and Saving Credit Association platform, inspired by the ~1 billion people around the world who are using mostly informal organizations to lend/ borrow, and support each other financially within their communities. ROSCAs will bootstrap the community, and WeTrust plans to build future products that include sovereign credit identities, trusted lending, mutual insurance, and more."
