        "en": "The WOOF token is the primary token for the WOOF NFT Marketplace, an upcoming open-for-all marketplace. Anyone can upload an NFT to our marketplace, and sales are conducted only with the WOOF token. Fees collected by the NFT sales are burned.\r\n\r\nWOOF on Solana also has a DEX that collects transaction fees which will be burned. WOOF is based on a deflationary model and is a one-stop location for NFT sales as well as token trading. The purpose of the project is to easily allow any person to list and sell an NFT, without barrier to entry or excessive listing fees."
