        "en": "We are the New Chance - NCE and We have made our second token.\r\n\r\nWe will create our own Crypto Exchange and as you know, the NCE token will be the basis. The team that prepares the whole surface for us has raised a proposal. Which is to create a second token. This would be necessary, in their view, because the current NCE 10 million would prove to be insufficient even for a medium level of traffic.The development team has set the example that the main pillar of binance is the BNB and they also have different trades with the WBNB. (e.g. pancakeswap ). In their opinion, we would like one of these on our stock market. The team we work with has made several stock exchanges. Therefore, we listen to them and create the WNCE token. Here's what you need to know about it:\r\nToken number: 1,000,000,000\r\nFee: 17%\r\n- 7% Reward\r\n- 9% Equity fund for the stock market\r\n- 1% auto LP"
