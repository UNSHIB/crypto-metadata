        "en": "WNYC stands for Wrapped NewYorkCoin and is simply an BEP-20 token that represents NewYorkCoin. One WNYC equals one NYC. NYC can be converted into WNYC and vice-versa. Being an BEP-20 token makes the transfer of WNYC slower than normal NewYorkCoin, but the key advantage of WNYC  is its integration into the world of Ethereum wallets, dapps, and smart contracts."
