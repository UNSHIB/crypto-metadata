        "en": "Blockchain technology is in a stage of ongoing development. Many aspects of our world may change with its evolution. Fundamentally, it is a decentralized and encrypted database of agreements. So it is plausible that Blockchain can truly disrupt multiple industries and make the processes more democratic, secure, transparent, and efficient. The blockchain serves as a bookkeeping platform or ledger that is incorruptible, enforces transparency, and can even bypass censorship. The result is a system for digital interactions that does not need a trusted third party. The work of securing digital relationships is implicit \u2014 supplied by the elegant, simple, yet robust network architecture of Blockchain technology itself.\r\n\r\nBoth customers and merchants are increasingly using digital currency today to make transactions, contributing to their growth and influence. In this burgeoning and relatively new marketplace, both sellers and buyers are recognizing the huge advantages that systems like Widecoin offer. The primary benefits of this e-commerce revolve around the fact that it eliminates limitations of time and geographical distance. In the process, e-commerce usually streamlines operations and lowers costs."
