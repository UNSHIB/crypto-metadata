        "en": "Winry Inu is a decentralized project that was birthed on the ERC20 platform. Winry Inu is the first of its kind in the sense of decentralization and community driven project participation. Offering redistribution to its holders on every transaction, supplying a form of passive income. \r\n\r\nAt Winry, we plan to work together as a community to become the next biggest project in the crypto-space today.\r\n\r\nFor utility, our holders can use our swap, found at https://winryswap.app. Future NFT Collections are in the works, with first a collection of 100 winrys, and then 1000."
