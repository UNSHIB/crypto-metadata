        "en": "Wrapped Origin Axie Token (WOA) is a token that allows users to wrap Origin Axies and trade them like an erc-20 token. You can only wrap Origin Axies from a common class (beast, plant, aquatic). In addition the Axie cannot contain any mystic parts and can\u2019t have been bred more than 2 times. These limitations ensure that the Origin Axies within the pool are all of similar value.\r\n\r\nWOA can be burnt to redeem a random Origin inside the WOA token pool."
