The call financial details are handled with a Smart Contract that uses our WHEN Token cryptocurrency. We have a bigger vision for the mobile app, including implementation of Patent Pending features. ICO funds will enable us to build on the momentum we have developed by continuing to enhance the app and increase user adoption. We have a white paper that outlines our vision, but more importantly we already have a shipping product on both Apple and Google app stores, greatly increasing our chances for success."
