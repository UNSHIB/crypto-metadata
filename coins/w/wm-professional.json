The growing popularity of social networks has further boosted the industry and has allowed the proliferation and diffusion of \"unverified\" information on the real ethical-professional qualities of companies, operators, and partners.\r\n \r\nThe Eucleia platform and WMPRO blockchain satisfy the need for a decentralized, secure, inviolable, certified database, with truthful and transparent information on the features of the companies and their operators.\r\n"
