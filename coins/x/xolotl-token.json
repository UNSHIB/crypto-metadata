        "en": "The XOTL team has selected the legendary Xoloitzcuintle indigenous dog as our avatar, since its two varieties represent the resistance and ancestral strength of the original peoples of Mesoamerica and it is with this force that we go out into the world today. XOTL Token is a deflationary and decentralized cryptocurrency, a favorite among an international community of people who like the art, trading and history of Mexico, as well as the metamodern knowledge of technology and new markets. Thus, our CEOs, Luis Alfredo Crist\u00f3bal De Dios, have managed to merge art, trading and science in a team of independent young people from Latin America who have brought together their talents to give new life to an ancestral symbol. that was once in danger of extinction and it is, thanks to the affection and attachment of the people, what have made it a great favorite around the world."
