        "en": "Benchmark Protocol's xMARK token is issued similarly to a LP token in exchange for staking MARK tokens in the Standard, Benchmark Protocol's single asset staking model.  xMARK is similar to a receipt in that you can exchange it back at anytime for the underlying MARK tokens.  \r\n\r\nAs MARK is a rebase token, the assets underlying the xMARK token will be affected by rebase; however, the number of xMARK tokens you own while staking, will never rebase. The exchange rate of xMARK to MARK tokens therefore will be dynamic"
