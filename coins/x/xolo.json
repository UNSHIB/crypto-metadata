        "en": "Xolo is a series of interest rate market contracts. Upon supplying assets to the Protocol, users and apps immediately begin earning a variable interest income. Interest accrues every block, which roughly corresponds to 3 seconds on BSC, and users can at any time withdraw their funds and accrued interest.\r\nWhen supplying assets to Xolo, a user receives the equivalent amount in xTokens \u2014 tokens that can be at any time redeemed for their underlying assets."
