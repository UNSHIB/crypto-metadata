        "en": "Kauri crypto project is developing link between \"\"offline\"\" and \"\"online\"\" world through tokenomics of ERC20 token Kauri. It\u2019s been build on bases of the already working infrastructure of many \u201creal-world\u201c assets (private reservations Avatar Eco Lodge and La PreciOsa in Costarica, luxury Yacht, many high-class apartments across the world, and others). \r\n\r\nKauri tokens could be used: (a) To get access to those \u201creal-world\u201c benefits within ecosystem's projects as user. This can be done through economic activity within the Kauri ecosystem (freezing KAUs or providing liquidity on the market). or (b) To participate in a specific ecosystem\u2019s project as investor. This can be done by allocating tokens to get part of project\u2019s profits."
