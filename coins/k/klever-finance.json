        "en": "The Klever Finance Token (KFI) is the Klever Blockchain governance token.\r\n\r\nKFI token holders will have an essential influence and crucial responsibility over the Klever Blockchain's function and have complete control over the apps protocol configuration (such as application fees and functionalities), as well as approval authority over new apps using an on-chain voting system.\r\n\r\nInside the Klever Blockchain, KLV is the main utility token used for transaction gas and energy usage - KFI is the governance token for the Klever community and its main utility is to empower a world-wide distributed community to innovate in p2p technologies and advance decentralized finance products and services.\r\n\r\nKFI holders will be able to use KFI on Klever Blockchain to:\r\n\r\nVote for new app proposals.\r\nVote for change of app proposals.\r\nVote for new projects.\r\nEarn network rewards when participating in the governance of the blockchain.\r\nKLV holders globally will be given the opportunity to mine KFI by adding KLV into daily mining pools. All KLV used to mine KFI will be burned and removed from KLV's circulating supply.\r\n\r\nOnly 150,000 KFI will initially be mined and the token is scarce in nature.\r\n\r\nA total max supply of 1,000,000 KFI will ever be created through a halving process, and the full minting process will autonomously be taking 20 years to complete."
