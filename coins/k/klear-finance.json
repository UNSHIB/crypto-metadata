        "en": "At Klear finance the goal is to create a genuinely trustworthy and transparent DeFi project which truly integrates the community. \r\n\u200b\r\nCommunity driven meme tokens are more popular than ever, however this also has had some negative effects on these types of projects and the cryptocurrency scene as a whole. Although there are many great projects of this kind out there, this whole space is currently riddled with terrible projects. Rugpull\u2019s are happening far too often, this is beginning to create a bad image for the space. \r\n\r\n\u200bKlear finance is here to offer a sound and trustworthy project. We intend to be the most transparent and honest out there, we are also looking for maximum involvement from the community. Klear finance will be consulting the community on all major decisions regarding the project as we understand how important the community is. Longer term a Klear ecosystem will be developed which will incorporate several crypto currency tools such as solo-staking, farming, our very own DEX, chart tool, wallet and launchpad. These are just the initial plans which again there will be consultation with the community on all of this, Klear finance would also be happy to implement other ideas for use cases for the project put forward by the community."
