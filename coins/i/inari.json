        "en": "Inari is a reflective ERC-20 community token with a dynamic fee structure, buyback, and black hole mechanics, which rewards holders, especially when whales take profit. \r\nThe token is characterized by two taxes both on buys and sells: the liquidity fee is split between buyback funds and marketing wallet; the redistribution is reflected to holders.\r\nThe difference between the two taxes is that the buy tax is fixed, while the sell tax is directly proportional to a sell's price impact, with minimum of 10% fee and maximum of 40% fee.\r\nEvery time a sell occurs, the contract buys back an amount of tokens proportional to the price impact as well. \r\nThis amount is determined as follows: buyback = baseAmount * (1 + (dynamicFee - staticFee) / staticFee) * K.\r\nAll the tokens bought back are sent to the dead address to be burned.\r\nFinally, since 60% of the initial supply was burned upon launch, and since the dead address also collects fees, as well as receiving the burned tokens, Inari is ultimate hyper-deflationary undumpable token."
