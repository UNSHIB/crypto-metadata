        "en": "iXcoin is one of the first Bitcoin clone created on 7 May 2011 just a few weeks after <a href=\"http://www.coingecko.com/coins/namecoin\">Namecoin</a>. iXcoin will reach maturity about 18 years before Bitcoin. By\r\nmid-2013, the number of iXcoin and Bitcoin will reach parity for a brief moment. iXcoin switched to merged mining with Bitcoin in 2012 and this helped increase the total hashrate of both currencies and make it more secure to 51% attack. Merged mining allows Bitcoin miners to mine multiple coins at the same time."
