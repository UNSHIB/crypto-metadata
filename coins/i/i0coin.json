        "en": "I0coin is merge mined with Bitcoin to produce a massive network hash rate and an energy efficient mining environment.  Very little extra energy is required to generate I0coins and secure its block chain.  I0coin's huge hash rate means it is the most secure crypto-currency with a block time under 10 minutes.  Its network hash rate ranks consistently in the top 5% compared to ALL other crypto-currencies.  Besides being very secure, I0coin has a very low rate of inflation because it's mostly mined already.  This guarantees the price will not be devalued due to new coins being circulated, as is the case with many other crypto-currencies.  In fact, many of the most popular cryptos don't even have a maximum coin cap.  They will be produced forever, and their price will suffer just like fiat currencies have for decades."
