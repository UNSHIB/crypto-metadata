The development of a Bitcoin and Ethereum mining farm will have a positive effect on Infinity Token investors through scheduled buy-backs and liquidity injections. $IT will give its investors the benefits of being a part of one of the first ERC-20 tokens to reward holders in Ethereum through proportional redistribution.
