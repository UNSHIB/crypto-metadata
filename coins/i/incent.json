Ingage\u2019s reward fuel is the INCNT cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nIncent monetises viewer attention on the back-end through programmatic advertising and content creators through premium services, with all fiat revenue recycled back into the open market for INCNT to manage Incent\u2019s ongoing ledger commitments.\r\n\r\nSince its launch in January 2020, Ingage has grown virally throughout the gamer-streamer community. As a result, over 7m INCNT tokens have been distributed to over 250,000 new crypto holders. INCNT was crowd-funded into existence following an ICO in late 2016. It is a cryptocurrency token which operates on the Waves blockchain. INCNT has a current supply of 46,016,598 and there are 46,016,573 in circulation."
