        "en": "Launching an ICO requires capital, know-how, expensive legal consul- ting, connections to crypto market participants and the right tokeni- zable idea from a startup. Additionally, ICO participants are disem- powered to perform proper due diligence on crypto participation opportunities, leading to potential scams and fraud. Legal ambiguity and no formal post-ICO reporting structure inevitably detracts many startups and investors from participating in the crypto markets.\r\n\r\nIconiq Lab is the world\u2019s rst batch-driven accelerator program for prospective ICO projects. Through our own token launch, we will raise the capital necessary to provide seed funding to the best projects and management teams interested in launching an ICO. We will source, perform due diligence on and accelerate the most promising projects to an ICO launch, holding program graduates to a fully-transparent de- velopment and nancial reporting standard. Collectively, this creates the best crypto and token participation opportunities for the crypto markets."
