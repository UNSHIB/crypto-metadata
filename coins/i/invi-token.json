Luxury brands and producers record information about their products on the blockchain and earn token rewards. The business that distributes luxury goods checks the movement/delivery during the distribution process, and the seller records the transaction record of the sale to obtain token rewards. Consumers can receive token rewards by verifying purchase records within the platform."
