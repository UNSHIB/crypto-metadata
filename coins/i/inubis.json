        "en": "Inubis is a 100% decentralised community-focused project that brings together DeFi, NFTs and gaming under one space. Inubis is hyperdeflationary in nature due to the automatic buy-back and burn feature that is in place.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of Inubis creators and the community is to help protect precious habitats around the world and all the endangered species which rely on them. A part of the transaction fees collected will be contributed to where the funding is most needed, which includes adopting and protecting habitats of animals like dolphins, rhinos, penguins, elephants, leopards, polar bears, pandas, and gorillas.\r\n\r\nMain features: Buyback & burn, Redistribution for holders, Adoption of animals from endangered species"
