        "en": "Success isn\u2019t measured by never falling down, success is measured by always getting back up. \r\n\r\nBorn out of the desire to always do better, to always be better, comes Integrity. \r\n\r\nOur last project had a major flaw in the code, which we announced to our investors upon our discovery.  Despite being completely undoxxed, we refunded our investors their losses. The explosion of support we received has been overwhelming.  We have turned a flaw in the code in our last project into a community that truly represents our beliefs.  By doing the right thing, and refunding our investors, we have built the most solid foundation of grassroots support you could imagine.  And now, like a phoenix rising out of the ashes, we are going to soar to all new heights. "
