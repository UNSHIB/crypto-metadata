        "en": "Inversely tracks the price of Polkadot (DOT) through price feeds supplied by an oracle. The entry point is $34.618 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when it reaches its upper limit of $51.928 (i.e. when Polkadot's value reaches $17.308) or its lower limit of $17.309 (i.e. when Polkadot\u2019s value reaches $51.927). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted for another with different limits."
