        "en": "Island Coin is a community-based, deflationary coin built on custom code with community redistributions and recurring burn events. When you join the island coin community, you\u2019re adopting a lifestyle. $ISLE has a host of new features that will enable it to weather current market corrections and deliver significant growth. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost is SAND, a community-first redistribution mechanism that awards holders. SAND captures and pools together 5% of every $ISLE transaction. Whenever the pool reaches a predetermined amount, the SAND redistributes to all holders with over 100M $ISLE with one wallet earning 25% of the pool, 50% going to 100 wallets and the rest of eligible wallets splitting 25%. In true island fashion, we also burn 5% of tokens. Instead of automatically burning, we will burn in weekly intervals on Friday.  "
