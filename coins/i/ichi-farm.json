The ICHI community has enabled many communities, including Bitcoin (oneBTC), Ethereum (oneETH), Chainlink (LINK), and more to govern their own in-house oneToken (ICHI stablecoin).  ICHI decides the allowed oracles, collateral, investment strategies, etc in exchange for protocol governance rewards.  The ICHI token is hard capped at 5M tokens."
