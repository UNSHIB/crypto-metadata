        "en": "Our aim is to be a community token, our ethos is simple, hold and be rewarded. Each transaction has a 10% fee with 5% being redistributed to holders and the other 5% going to the liquidity pool to keep a steady price. We have used celebrity endorsements to build a telegram community of almost 7000 members and over 10k followers on our instagram. We have seen a 1000% increase on our first hour of launch and have locked liquidity for 6 months."
