        "en": "Euler.Tools is a new way to understand the blockchain. We are translating the complex architecture into delightful and reusable data representations that should provide insight on the transactions. Starting with our Euler explorer, and moving towards a trading interface, we will introduce a smooth user experience focused on explaining the blockchain. Backed by a utility token that can be used both for payments or liquidity mining, we will create a deflationary mechanism by buying back tokens and burning them."
