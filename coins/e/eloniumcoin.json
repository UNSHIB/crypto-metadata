        "en": "Elonium is a startup initiated in the Dutch construction industry. The ELNC token is a project also created by them. The CEO of Elonium, Sander Struive has spent many years in construction firsthand and has noticed many problems affecting the general safety, efficiency and quality of construction projects, we're talking about problems like miscommunication due to language barriers, outdated learning and instructional material and more issues on a greater scale.\r\n\r\nElonium plans to tackle these problems head on and resolve them, starting with the introduction of a mobile application which will provide a digital construction platform hosting up to date videos and instructional materials for projects and architect schools. It will also host a social platform where people involved in the industry may share their own works or browse others.\r\n\r\nA case scenario could be that a contractor hires workers for his project by checking out their portfolios on the app. Our Token will also act as currency to purchase various commodities using the application, ranging from merch to construction materials."
