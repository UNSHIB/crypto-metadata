        "en": "Emrals was founded in 2014 beginning with the idea of a cryptocurrency that would reward you for cleaning up trash in your neighborhood. We're proud to be an Open Source project.   Based on the well tested Dash, the original masternode coin with big rewards, Emrals is here to grow a community of those who want to prosper. It\u2019s Dash for trash.  Combined with our app to get paid cleaning up trash, IoT smart trash can that auto sorts and pays you to recycle, and paid impact zone subscriptions that channel funding into your neighborhood, Emrals rewards city cleanup and helps keep our streets and oceans clean.\r\n\r\n"
