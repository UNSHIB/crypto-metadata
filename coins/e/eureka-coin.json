It\u2019s a coin that will be the native coin of its own blockchain,the Eureka Network and there are many projects interested in building upon it. The EurekaNetwork blockchain will not only be proof of stake itself ( meaning EurekaCoin in itself can be used to earn passively ) but other tokens/ sidechain coins will be able to be proof of stake in themselves securing their own network."
