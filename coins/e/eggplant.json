        "en": "Eggplant exchange, inspired by Pancake Swap, is a brand new DEX on the Binance Smart chain. Our exchange will feature both swaps and high APR liquidity pools. Stage 2 of the DEX will aim to use Band Protocol to bring synthetic assets onto the exchange and provide new opportunities to trade traditional assets outside of centralized exchanges.\r\n\r\nOur token features a unique deflationary design that exponentially decreases the total supply with every transaction made. $EGGPLANT is 100% decentralized, meaning it is completely community led and created by volunteers."
