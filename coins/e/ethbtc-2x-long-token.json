The ETH BTC 2x Beverage Token (RATIOMOON) is a type of collateralized loan product that gives you leveraged long exposure to ETH against BTC. RATIOMOON rebalances using a similar algorithm to Binance Leverage Tokens. This means Beverage tokens do not rebalance daily, are not forced to maintain a constant leverage and rebalance during extreme market movements only."
