        "en": "e-Money stablecoins are a further stage in the development of collateralized stablecoins, but with some great advantages of their own which truly set them apart.\r\nFirstly, e-Money stablecoins are not prone to the many drawbacks and inherent instability of algorithmic stablecoins. e-Money stablecoins are collateralized in the same currency as which they are issued so the eEUR stablecoin is collateralized in Euros. The simplicity of this system also means that currency-backed stablecoins are highly efficient and liquid."
