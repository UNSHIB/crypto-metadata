        "en": "TheEXCCcoin was created in 2017 to provide finance in support of an idea to build a decentralised exchange platform. The platform was developed to offer services to semi-professional cryptocurrency traders. The Exchange Coin is one of the rare cryptocurrencies with a value reflected in the features of real products. It is similar to the traditional market and stock exchange setting. This project has been developed based on a solid foundation and innovative plans which is aimed at providing long-term benefits to all holders of theEXCCcoins."
