By the latest estimates, the bitcoin network uses as much energy in one year as the country of Argentina.\r\n\r\nEnviro aims to slow down this damage. 50% of our daily auto-generated liquidity will be donated to enviromental charities voted on by our community. It's time to use the blockchain for good."
