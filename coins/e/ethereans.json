        "en": "The Ethereans Operating System\u2014is an operating system for Ethereum, comprising three integrated protocols. The first is a platform for on-chain organizations, which are like DAOs, but more sophisticated and decentralized. The second is a platform for the Item token standard, which is like the evolution of the ERC1155 standard. The third is Covenants, a suite of DeFi applications built on top of the first ever on-chain AMM Aggregator.\r\n\r\nThis is the first ever completely on-chain, general-purpose platform for all governance, development and applications on Ethereum\u2014a bona fide OS. Use it for anything\u2014even if just as a base layer to code on the network."
