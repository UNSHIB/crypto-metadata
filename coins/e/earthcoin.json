        "en": "Earthcoin is a descendant of Litecoin. Earthcoin uses a 365 day period and its block reward varies in a sine curve with an amplitude of 2,000 over a period of one year (like the Earth moving around the Sun). \r\n\r\nEarthcoin block reward starts at 10,000 coins and adjusts at each block. A maximum of 12,000 coins per block will be reached after about 3 months from launch, then descend gradually to approximately 10,000 coins per block at about 6 months. Then a new minimum of 8,000 coins per block will be reached at about 9 months and this figure goes back up again to 10,000 coins per block after one year. After this, the payout is cut in half."
