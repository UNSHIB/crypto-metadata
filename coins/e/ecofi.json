        "en": "EcoFi is an open-source, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol built to power safe and responsible innovation in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. \r\n\r\nThe EcoFi protocol is designed to equitably disburse value among system participants through a unique infrastructure hinging on infinite scarcity, made possible due to the unique mechanics of EcoFi's distribution mechanism. This is achieved by staking ECO tokens through the EcoFi protocol to mint SPRT tokens.\r\n\r\nSPRT tokens can be used to purchase digital goods from an ecosystem connected to the EcoFI Platform comprising numerous marketplaces. The first such marketplace will be the HyperObject FINE ART NFT Gallery, a one-of-a-kind digital art gallery featuring FINE ART NFTs backed by distinct physical editions.\r\n\r\nOnce the marketplace is sufficiently stable, EcoFi will transition to a DAO governance model."
