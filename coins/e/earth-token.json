        "en": "EARTH brings the best of frictionless deflationary yield protocols and combines them with instant, block-by-block rewards through staking and yield farming with the promise to offer the most competitive rewards (APYs) possible without token inflation since it has a fixed supply.\r\n3% transaction tax goes to holders, stakers and a development fund, which is used for spreading further awareness. Funds grows with every transaction, and provides us a simple way to create an ever increasing pool of funds that will go towards expanding the $EARTH brand.\r\nEARTH mechanics differ from most staking protocols with the reward pool that provides farming rewards with guaranteed token rewards on every single block whether an $EARTH transaction occurred on the current BSC block or not.\r\nEvery member in our community deserves a sustainable high yield!"
