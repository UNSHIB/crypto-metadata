        "en": "There are dozens, if not hundreds of blockchain projects released daily around the world that have no value to the end user or the crypto-community. Unfortunately, many software developers look at blockchain not just as a new and promising technology, but as a way to make easy money. For us, blockchain has a huge potential in mobile and computer gaming sectors, allowing to widen the player\u2019s possibilities. This is why we decided to create a game that would have an exciting and\r\ncaptivating game process, and be beneficial for the players in many ways, including financial. Our team is happy to introduce Ether Kingdoms \u2014 a project for the wide international gaming audience with its own IMP crypto-token. \r\n\r\nEther Kingdoms is a new crypto-game with its own ERC20 token, IMP. Key features: up to 365% annual POS reward, ERC-721 items, no ICO, fair airdrop distribution only, already tradable on several exchanges. Expand your Ether Kingdom: fight for glory, mine, trade!"
