        "en": "Endor.coin is reinventing predictive analytics by democratizing access to Artificial Intelligence data analysis, making it accessible, trustless, censorship-resistance and useful for all. This is achieved through the Endor.coin Protocol, offering the world\u2019s first automated, self-served, predictive platform that allows business users and unprofessional crypto-token holders alike to ask complex predictive questions and obtain high-quality results in minutes. This aims to democratize the field of Data Science, that today is reserved mostly for Fortune500 companies. Endor.coin is based on the novel science of Social Physics developed at MIT by the project\u2019s team members Prof. Alex Pentland and Dr. Yaniv Altshuler"
