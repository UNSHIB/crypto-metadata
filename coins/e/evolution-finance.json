        "en": "Evolution Finance is a self-funded project that will change the way users interact with DeFi locked liquidity and money markets. Evolution Finance is targeting DeFi lending of the top 50 ERC20 altcoins and ERC-wrapped native coins, with a fair token distribution model at launch. We believe a fair token distribution is key to building the community that a dominating DeFi platform needs. At launch 100% of EVN tokens will be made available through liquidity pools on Uniswap."
