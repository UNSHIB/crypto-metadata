        "en": "EXODIA is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the EXOD token. Each EXOD token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, FTM) in the EXODIA treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. EXODIA also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding."
