        "en": "Our platform is the first implementation of \u2018American options\u2019 on any cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain. This option style bestows upon its traders the necessary flexibility to hedge positions in a nascent volatile market such as Ethereum\u2019s. We make use of a hybrid exchange model, where orders are resolved onchain, but order creation and dispersion is done completely offchain. It is completely non-custodial with no restrictions imposed upon deposits or withdrawals."
