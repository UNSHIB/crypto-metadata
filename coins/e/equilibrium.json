        "en": "Equilibrium Games is a gaming company that thrives to unite the gaming industry and the Blockchain world. Our mission is to make blockchain games with a player driven economy. Instead of third party market makers everyone can trade between each other what they want with their own prices. The economy of our games is controlled by the people: You can be the owner of a terrain and charge other players that want to play or trade in your terrain taxes, kill monsters to acquire Equilibrium or be a graphic designer and get rewarded for people buying your cosmetic items."
