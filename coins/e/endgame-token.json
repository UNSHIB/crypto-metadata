        "en": "Endgame Token is a new Meme token like no other; with many real use cases and confirmed charity partnerships. We are also developing a fun augmented reality game as well as an online Comic book.We are a Charity Token based around the Avengers end-game concept. we will be launching an augmented reality game/app similar to that of Pokemon-go, where a global treasure hunt will take place in order to locate each infinity stone. Along the way we will be giving out prizes as each stone is located.\r\n\r\nOur belief is that we are all big kids inside and all deserve a hero. So we want to be the heroes for children around the world. As such, we will be supporting all charitable causes and organisations children related. we genuinely care about our charitable causes and unlike many other charity coins we have gone out and secured first of their kind partnerships with leading charities and causes. we already have a partnership with the Drogba Foundation headed up by world famous football Icon Drogba. Drogba has actively posted about us on his Instagram page over the past few weeks. 2 more globally recognised children\u2019s charities should be announced in the coming weeks as our partners. "
