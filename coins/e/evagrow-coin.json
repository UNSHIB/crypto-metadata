EvaGrow holders will earn 6% rewards from every transaction in BUSD, which is automatically sent to their wallets. When the price drops our team will use the buy-back wallet to keep the price growing. 2% of every transaction will be allocated to the buy-back wallet. The contract automates liquidity for price stability. 2% of every transaction is contributed liquidity for the community."
