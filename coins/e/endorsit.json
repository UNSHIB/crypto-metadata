        "en": "Endorsit is an underlying content network in this post Internet era. It is a blockchain (Endorsit Chain) empowered all-encompassing content hub, and a true community that embodies all forms of content.It strives to create an ecosystem in which global content creators, readers, promoters and investors can work in a new relation mode that is unlike the existing Internet. \r\n\r\nThe value of a content platform depends on its users. Those users who create good content, use contents, reward the contents or interact with other users re-garding the contents all made contributions to the healthy growth of the plat-form, yet users are not rewarded properly under the current mechanism. This is why we establish Endorsit. It is blockchain technology empowered and based on a pure market consensus mechanism, to ensure quality content would pop up while guaranteeing the strongest possible attention from users."
