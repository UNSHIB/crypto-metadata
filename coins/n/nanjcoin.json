        "en": "NANJCOIN is an Ethereum token developed and managed by the users of 2ch.sc\u2019s \u201cNandemo Jikkyou\u201d message board, or NanJ for short. The Nandemo Jikkyou board is a place where passionate sports fans (also known as Nanjinians or J-Boys) gather and engage in sublimely trivial banter day and night. Shortly after its creation, the NANJCOIN Discord community quickly gained momentum, attracting a variety of members from all walks of life, and continues to grow by the day.\r\n\r\nNANJCOIN was conceived with the mission of better enjoying sports and aims to expand by working together with business partners in the sports industry. By making transactions with NANJCOIN, you will reap greater and more unique benefits unobtainable through regular payment methods. In addition, NANJCOIN will also provide a system for conveniently making donations to sports organizations in need of financial support, be they individual players, teams, niche domestic sports with little backing, or even regional sports clubs. (From Stage 3) NANJ plans to implement a voting system through which members can use tokens to nominate various sports teams to be managed directly by the community."
