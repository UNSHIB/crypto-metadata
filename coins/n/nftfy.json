It is the trustless way of sharing ownership of NFTs, allowing the connection to all the DeFi functionalities and bringing instant liquidity to the NFT ecosystem.                    \r\n \r\nIt is a permissionless protocol that allows anyone to generate ERC20-compliant fungible Fractions fully backed by the NFT.  Once you do that, you create a whole new market full of possibilities, being able to integrate the NFT Fractions into all the other DeFi applications. \r\n\r\n$NFTFY Utility\r\nThe main function of the token is to amass and discover value within the $NFTFY ecosystem. As the many new ERC20-compliant Fractions are generated by the community, the $NFTFY token acts as a liquidity booster for all the users.\r\n\r\nLiquidity Mining, Farming and Airdrops will be used to stimulate the liquidity in the Balancer Pools containing $NFTFY tokens. Anyone can easily participate in the rewards programs as any pool created on Balancer protocol containing the $NFTFY token as collateral is automatically eligible to participate in our Liquidity Mining program.
