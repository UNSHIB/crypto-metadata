        "en": "Nyerium is a new crypto-currency aimed at the unbanked. It is designed to find a solution to the problem of remittance and payment for the unbanked.\r\n\r\nNyerium's goal is to open the global market to population from Africa, Middle East and other emerging countries and give them the possibility to transact at low cost and contribute to the development in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of Nyerium is emerging markets, particularly the African continent and the Middle east. In many of the countries targeted electronic payment is still new, while mobile phone payment is maturing. However, hefty fees are adding unnecessary burden on those most in need. We are joining effort to address those deficiencies and to help the neediest to improve their daily lives.\r\n\r\nNyerium would be innovative while bringing a humanitarian angle to the way which crypto-currencies are used to help connect the most in need."
