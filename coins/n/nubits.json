        "en": "NuBits (NBT) are the world's first stable decentralized digital currency. One NuBit is designed to always be worth USD 1.00.\r\n\r\nNuBits was released on 23 September 2014 by a veteran group of Peercoin developers and community members led by Jordan Lee. It was developed from the same stable and secure code that Peercoin and Bitcoin use. A full white paper, FAQs, technical documentation, and other information are available on <a href=\"http://www.nubits.com\">www.nubits.com</a>.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in history, anyone can safely and privately store a digital currency that is stable in value by using NuBits.\r\n\r\n"
