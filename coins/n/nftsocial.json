        "en": "NFTSOCIAL is a platform where content producers and daily social media users can easily meet. Users gain partial ownership of the content created by content producers by voting. Users in NFTSOCIAL are included in the ever-growing NFT industry with an easy interface thanks to this fragmented ownership and benefit from low network fees. In addition, the most liked and voted NFTs among the NFTs they own are exhibited in the marketplace by auction and the profits are transferred to the partial owners. Displaying content in NFTSOCIAL is quite easy. Anyone can submit their content for voting by simply sharing images from within the application. NSC token provides voting power and value on the platform. Simply put, NFTSOCIAL attracts social media users who are still far from the blockchain and crypto industry, giving every user the opportunity to earn NSC and get involved in the NFT industry."
