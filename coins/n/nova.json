In the Nova ecosystem, both the content creator, the sifter, the investor, and the eco-builder can get the corresponding Token incentives. So as to improve the efficiency of the whole content industry chain and build a new ecology of the content industry with high efficiency, fairness and transparency.\r\n\r\nNOVA, as a cryptographic token issued by the project, will flow through the entire ecosystem. Every user who contributes to the ecology can transform and obtain the corresponding NOVA according to the algorithm. And in the actual application scenarios in the ecology, such as business cooperation, rewards, cash withdrawal fees, etc., will need to use NOVA."
