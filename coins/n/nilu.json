        "en": "Nilu is a blockchain-based platform with a wide range of applications. Besides providing a cryptocurrency platform, it can also be used to create tokens (ERC20) and deploying DAPPs (Decentralized Applications). Its infrastructure is the same as Ethereum, therefore it inherits Ethereum\u2019s features and potential usages. Nilu\u2019s core development team is primarily focused on facilitating blockchain usages for a broad range of potential users from all walks of life. Nilu is not susceptible to pre-mining due to its philosophy and lack of a predominant co-founder group or major shareholder that can potentially create a monopoly over the currency and the ecosystem. Simply by mining, buying Nilu coins or developing Nilu-based DAPPs one can become a member of Nilu community."
