        "en": "Newton Coin Project was created to help fund research and development projects in the medical and renewable energy fields.  \r\n\r\nIt is no secret, that many important medical research projects in the world are underfunded or completely lack funding altogether. Our mission with Newton Project is to change that.  We believe that through our commitment to helping fund these projects, we can aid in potentially finding cures for many diseases that still plague humanity. However, that is just one area of research we intend on focusing on.\r\n\r\nNewton Coin Project is also looking to fund research and development of new forms of renewable energy. Many communities in under developed countries would greatly benefit from low cost renewable energy projects.\r\n\r\nBecause Newton Coin is a crypto project, Newton will fund other crypto projects in this field as well as any scientific research that supports Newton Coin and the community. One of our goals is to make Newton Coin the primary payment system in the research and science field.\r\n\r\nThe success of our project means the ability to make important changes in the world.  Ultimately, in order for this to happen, we need YOU, to help us achieve our goal."
