        "en": "NBNG is a governance token issued by SENGOKU SWAP.FINANCE (SSF), Japan's first international decentralized exchange (DEX). NBNG is an ERC20 token, with a total token count of 1 billion NBNG as a protocol token for SSF.\r\n\r\nYield farming at SSF ensures liquidity. If you deposit an ETH and NBNG currency pair (LP) in SSF and provide liquidity, you will get NBNG as a secondary incentive. You can also earn NBNG as a secondary incentive by staking each currency alone."
