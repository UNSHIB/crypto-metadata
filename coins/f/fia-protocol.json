        "en": "FIA is a Metaverse protocol with a succinct blockchain. Current cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum store hundreds of gigabytes of data, and as time goes on, their blockchains will only increase in size. With Fia however, no matter how much the usage grows, the blockchain always stays the same size - about 22kb (the size of an image). This means participants can quickly sync and verify the network."
