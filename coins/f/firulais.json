        "en": "What\u2019s the Firulais Finance project?\r\n\r\nFirulais Finance is a community-focused DeFi project that made a fair launch of Firulais (FIRU) cryptocurrency. The startup plans to release three products. The first is NFT Marketplace, where users could stake $FIRU tokens and get rewards with NFTs. The second product is FiruWallet, available on iOS and Android. It will allow people to store and transfer cryptocurrencies. Finally, the devs want to launch a FiruDex \u2013 a decentralized crypto exchange with low commissions. As a result, users could trade and swap ERC20 assets to BEP20 tokens.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the FIRU token?\r\n\r\nThe FIRU token is an ERC20 token with an auto-reward function. So, the Firulais smart contract takes a 2% fee from each transaction to reallocate them among all existing token-holders. That\u2019s how Auto Rewards Farming (ARF) works. Moreover, the Firulais team does not have tokens because 50% of the total supply is on Unicrypt, while the remaining coins are on the burn wallet. Also, the management aims to issue $FIWT Token for the transactions\u2019 payments between FIRUWALLET \u2013 FIRUDEX. So, $FIRU token-holders will get a share of $FIWT emission for free."
