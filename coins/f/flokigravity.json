        "en": "Combining the newly introduced elastic supply mechanics META along with clever buybacks, calculated social marketing movement and several upcoming tools, Floki Gravity will establish itself as a mass adoption unparalleled DEFI pioneer champion.\r\nFlokiHammer REBASE\r\nFloki Gravity is the first born FLOKI from the newly introduced elastic supply token META. This means that $FLOKIG supply (total number of tokens) is always decreasing, leading each token to a mathematically guaranteed price of $1,337,000 USD. Supply and price changes happen every 4 hours if they weren\u2019t already manually triggered by the FlokiHammer and they are called \u201cRebases\u201d. Rebases will push the price to a rising price peg by burning supply, making it a gravity-free upcoin."
