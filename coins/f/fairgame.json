        "en": "Based on Ethereum, Fair.game uses decentralized technology and smart contract to ensure the fairness of games. Fair.Game will be launched globally in different languages and multi-terminal versions (WEB, APP, H5). Fair.Game combines the features of blockchain (\u201copen, fair and just\u201d) and online games in an innovative way. It eliminates various problems in traditional games such as blackbox operation, non-transparent numerical algorithm and inequality among players. The platform will significantly increase the trust of the players and the fees that paying players are willing to spend on the game."
