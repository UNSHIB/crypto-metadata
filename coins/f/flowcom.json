        "en": "FlowCom sets out to connect the society in various aspects. Such connections cover both the telecommunication (e.g., 5G connections, satellite-based internet connections) and finances (e.g., DeFi, e-commerce). FiG is a native currency of the FlowCom ecosystem, which is purposely designed to be deflationary due to the buy-back-then-burn mechanism of FlowCom."
