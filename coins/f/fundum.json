        "en": "COMBINING CRYPTO & PROPERTY\r\nReal Estate property that is mortgage-free becomes profitable for both the owners and the holders of the FND  Stable coins. Tokenizing new property adds a new financing model and disrupts the current mortgage system ruled by banks.\r\n\r\nRental income rights are sold using FND STABLE COINS. Holders of the FND Stable Coins will earn a residual monthly return paid in FND Tokens.\r\n\r\nAs an investor, you purchase either or both the FND Stable Coin connected to one or more Real Estate Properties and/or the FND Token we use as a payout for the rents.\r\n\r\nBy holding a certain amount of FND Stable Coins you purchase the right to receive the percentage of the rent that corresponds to the amount of Stable Coins in your wallet.\r\n\r\nResidual income for as long as you hold the Stable Coins"
