        "en": "The core idea of FACTS is to construct a set of \u201cFactual Content Incentive Mechanism \u201cthat is based on blockchain technology, namely Proof of Facts (PoF). Users can obtain the right of reward allocation through any operational behavior on the factual content. By doing so, they help to solve current problems on the Internet such as massive false content, underpowered creation, low propagation efficiency and so on.FACTS uates content through the \u201cFACTS Index\u201d assessment model which provides a strong credibility reference for content review panel and users. After the assessment, the trusted content is stored in the Facts Pool and then is automatically used to build Facts Graph through the NLP engine."
