        "en": "FEG Token is redesigning the way decentralized finance (DeFi) is structured. FEG Token is focused on reshaping and evolving how DeFi works completely while delivering the most robust ecosystem ever designed for DeFi's much-needed advancements.\r\n\r\nFEG Token is a hyper-deflationary DeFi token built to succeed!\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind FEG Token is to provide a decentralized transaction network, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20) and the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20). The path forward for FEG Token is determined by market fluctuations, but the model it runs on begs FEG Token to succeed.\r\n\r\nFEG Token is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum circulating supply of 100Q (quadrillion) on both the Ethereum blockchain and the Binance Smart Chain that involves an inaccessible burn wallet. Depending on each holder\u2019s percentage of ownership, a 2% transaction tax is distributed among all holders\u2014this includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. There is no limit as to how many tokens can be burnt. Without a burning limit, holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure!"
