        "en": "Feirm uses blockchain technology and is building a decentralised & secure platform that is easy to use and private by design. Over-time this PWA will house a number of ways for investors to use the XFE token for example; a marketplace, mini games, lotteries and our social media reward program will distribute XFE tokens to investors. It can also be used as a wallet to store your XFE tokens securely alongside other BEP-20 tokens, ERC-20 tokens from the ETH network and coins from the BTC network to save the need for a 3rd party wallet."
