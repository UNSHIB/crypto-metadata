Building your fantasy team will have you choose from the available list of professional players.\r\n\r\nBased on the performance of the selected players, your team will accumulate or lose points. Positive events (such as scoring goals, contributing assists, keeping a clean sheet) will add points to your team. Negative events (such as receiving yellow/red cards, conceding goals, missing penalties) will see the players lose points. Moreover, players\u2019 positions are of relevance as they have a direct impact on how they score in the game. Build a team with efficient players, who will score high and make you win!"
