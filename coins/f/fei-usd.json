        "en": "FEI uses a new kind of stablecoin mechanism called direct incentives. It is more capital-efficient, has a fair distribution, and is fully decentralized. The protocol uses the value it controls to maintain liquid secondary markets.\r\n\r\nFei Labs is the team that created FEI, a highly scalable, decentralized, and reserve-backed stablecoin that can meet DeFi\u2019s needs without relying on centralized assets for collateral, that unlocks next-generation integration potential. Our mission is to be the stable coin of DeFi backed by some of the top minds in the space, including a16z, Nascent, Variant, Coinbase,"
