        "en": "ForeverFOMO is a price-elastic token with adjusting supply, moving towards the price of Bitcoin. Different then just a normal pegged token/stable coin, rebases make price-elastic tokens into synthetic commodities with fluctuating values and supplies that gradually stabilize. Ultimately, rebases are designed to be tradable and potentially extremely profitable.  \r\nEvery 4 hours there is a change in supply called a 'rebase'. The rebase is automatically triggered by an online dashboard.  Negative rebases are amplified to make ForeverFOMO return to positive rebase territory faster. Rebases are triggered 6 times a day. for 360 Epochs, every 8 hours or 1 epoch, ForeverFOMO will do a price rebase that will increase the price 8%.   \r\nForeverFOMO plans to branch into the NFT marketplace within 30 days as well.
