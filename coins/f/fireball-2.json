        "en": "FIRE powers revolutionary staking pools & yield farms. It utilizes a specialized RFI Token structure enabling infinite pool rewards all while maintaining a fixed supply.\r\n\r\nAs an RFI token FIRE uses a fair system of taxing each token transaction with a constant percentage. This restocks the yield farm and staking reward pools, and redistributes rewards to holders to create further value for its users.\r\n\r\nDuring the launch phase of FIRE, 50% of the supply was sent to the token contract for farm/staking pool rewards. By sending FIRE to this contract it became a FIRE holder - and like all other FIRE holders, this receives a portion of all FIRE transaction fees restocking the reward supply. Unlike other holders of FIRE, when the balance of this contract exceeds 500 billion it will begin providing liquidity to the MATIC/FIRE LP, until the balance falls below this set amount."
