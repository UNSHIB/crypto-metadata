What\u2019s unique about their initiative is that they want to do this while giving back to their community supporters. What is unique about FlokiFrunkPuppy is we have a Frunky Hour.\r\n\r\nWhat is Frunky hour?\r\n\r\nFrunky Hour is a revolutionary idea in which we change the buy and sell tax at random points during the day. Currently, this is set to 0% buy and 30% sell. This is done to allow investors to buy in and not get taxed on any of their buys! So you can ape 10 BNB in FlokiFrunkPuppy and receive 10 BNB worth of FlokiFrunkPuppy tokens."
